		<description><![CDATA[Gerry, 
A few comments got caught in limbo and I just saw them. Thanks for reading and for the positive feedback. I remember handing out your targets to shooters during the match. Wish I&#039;d gotten the opportunity to meet your wife. Learning to shoot builds confidence in so many ways. Come back and please introduce yourself next year.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks! It was a long few days but I miss it already. As for the medical staff, that was the only instance where an ambulance was called. Everything else was dealt with onsite. I&#039;m proud to be part of the volunteer staff.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for volunteering.  This match would not be possible without people like you that sacrifice their time in order for the rest of us to shoot. Thanks also for the updates.   I did not know an ambulance had to be called and it probably saved the mans life, great job by Frank and Paula for having someone on site to attend to medical emergencies.]]></description>

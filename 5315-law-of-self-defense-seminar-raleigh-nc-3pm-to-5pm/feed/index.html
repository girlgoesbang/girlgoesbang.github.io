		<description><![CDATA[Wow, thanks for the kind words! I&#039;m blushing.

FYI, we almost always have lawyers attend the seminars--in fact, the seminars are certified for Continuing Legal Education (CLE) credits for the lawyers (4.0 hours general, counselors), it&#039;s where the lawyers come to learn self-defense law.  We almost always have a cop or two in the audience, as well, and sometimes even a prosecutor or judge.  :-)  

But don&#039;t let that intimidate anybody, one needn&#039;t be a lawyer or a cop to get full value from the seminar--we work hard on translating all that legalese into plain English--indeed, it&#039;s the single greatest compliment we get on our book, as well as the seminars.

FYI, this Raleigh class is filling up very fast.  If it keeps up at this rate I might try to get bigger space, but that&#039;s never a guarantee.  And this will almost certainly be the ONLY seminar in NC for 2015.  Just sayin&#039;. There&#039;s 50 states, and only one of me. :-)

Look forward to meeting you there, Sadie (and all the rest of you)!

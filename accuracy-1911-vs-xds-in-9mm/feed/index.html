		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m trying to coordinate time with my gun smith so I can watch while he replaces all the springs. I&#039;m interested enough to want to see the process on my gun. He also said he&#039;d test the weight of the trigger pull before and after if I remember to remind him. Unfortunately that&#039;s going to mean a Saturday and he only works every other Saturday. He was down with the flu last Saturday so I&#039;m being patient. 

Here&#039;s a link to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8yBiTYAyJ8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;video that shows how to replace all the springs&lt;/a&gt;. That&#039;s a bit more than I want to manage on my own - especially as I don&#039;t have all the tools. I think this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shop.powderriverprecision.net/media/XDsse.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; provides a bit more detail that&#039;s not quite clear on the video. The guy in the video takes about 15 minutes to replace all the parts. My gunsmith says it&#039;s taken him about 30 minutes. I&#039;m guessing it would take me 2 hours or more -- assuming I could actually get everything back together. 

I&#039;ll add a new post once it&#039;s all done and add a link here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.powderriverprecision.net/product.sc?productId=87&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Powder River Precision XDS trigger spring kit&lt;/a&gt; for a few reasons: 
- It&#039;s the only trigger kit I&#039;m aware of
- It&#039;s under $20 for the kit
- I quit after 26 rounds because my trigger finger was fatigued. Seriously. 
- I want to shoot it in a BUG (back up gun) match and I need to be able to shoot 4 to 5 times that many rounds at a match.

I&#039;ve asked my gunsmith to measure the trigger pull for me before and after the spring swap. I&#039;ll post an update once we get that done. 

Thanks for the comment!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice Shooting, 
Is your gunsmith doing a full trigger job or doing the Spring and Sear swap?
Honestly that gun is shooting really well for you, I wouldnt have messed with a good thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for reading. I&#039;m sorry for your loss. Oddly, my insurance company didn&#039;t ask for receipts except for the computer. They did ask for serial numbers on the firearms. Based on a comment made by the Detective, if you have any gun bumper stickers on your vehicle you might consider removing them. They will make your vehicle a target for thieves. Frustrating. But that&#039;s the reality of sharing what you are passionate about to the public.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My truck was broken into in the Charlotte area in November while eating dinner.  Got my range bag with three guns, accessories, a couple of laptops, my suitcase, and two big toolboxes.  About $7k all told.  You are right, filing a claim is a huge pain.  Receipts, or boxes, or pictures. Did the same as you with a spreadsheet, but there are some things (particularly tools) that I had owned for years with no receipts or any proof of ownership.  

Glad everything worked out for you.  I wouldn&#039;t wish it on anyone.]]></description>

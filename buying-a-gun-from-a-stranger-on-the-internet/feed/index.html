		<description><![CDATA[Paul, Thanks!

So far I picked up 6 additional magazines from Arms Unlimited for $24.95 each. Free Shipping. 
Link here: http://www.armsunlimited.com/Smith-Wesson-SW-MP-9mm-17-Round-Pistol-Magazine-p/19440.htm
The free shipping was fast. I think I had them in 3-4 days. They are not aftermarket, they are S&amp;W magazines. 

Then I ordered an extended magazine release. Here are the details: http://21cg.us/shop/index.php/catalyst/m-p-catalyst-pre-order-special.html
although I ordered it from Brownell&#039;s. I will install that this weekend. Then I may get a friend to ground it down just a bit to avoid popping out the magazines on a table start. 

I have a kydex holster and mag pouches ordered from a local supplier and should have then the weekend before Christmas. Then I can start working on dry fire with my draw. 

The Trigger Kit is definitely something I&#039;m considering. Another friend put one in his gun. He also put in the curved polymer trigger initially, but recently decided to try the newer Flat faced trigger that is more like a 1911 found here https://store.apextactical.com/WebDirect/Products/Details/191834. He likes that setup on his gun best.

I seem to have lucked out and gotten a trigger that was done right or well broken in as I have no complaints about what came with the gun. I will compare what I have with the gun that now has a flat faced trigger and I would like to compare what I have versus what you&#039;ve done with yours, so thank you and I&#039;d love to take you up on the offer next time we are both at a match.

<p>For several reasons, I became interested in purchasing an M&amp;P Pro in 9mm. The short version is that it is fairly narrow on the grip up near the tang and I&#8217;ve been struggling with keeping my grip consistent when I shoot. I loved my 1911 when I could get it to run. It was very narrow with super slim grips, but I&#8217;ve given up that battle. I wanted to find a gun with a narrow grip that has a reputation for being reliable. The M&amp;P Pro fits those requirements.</p>
<p>I have a friend that bought the M&amp;P CORE. It&#8217;s almost the same gun except for the option to swap optical site on/off the slide. The fixed sites are higher to ensure they will co-witness if the optic is installed (ie: you can use the fixed sights along with the optical sight), but the frame, trigger, and magazines are identical. He&#8217;s been making some upgrades and I really like how the gun handles. So I started doing some research to determine cost and purchase options.</p>
<p>I started with gunwatcher.com. This site will give you a quick overview of current new prices, auction prices and classified prices. In this case the lowest new price was $551. Assume you&#8217;d also pay shipping and FFL fees. I found a used pistol in the &#8220;Classified&#8221; section that pointed to Armslist.com. The pistol was in a city about 2.5 hours away from me. The price was $475. The seller did mention the gun had a scratch and showed that in a photo. The price was good but not good enough to schedule 5 hours of driving.</p>
<p>A week or two passed. I planned a trip to a beach in South Carolina to visit family. I checked the ad again and the price had been dropped to $425. I checked the map and a detour through Wilmington added no significant driving time to return home. Although I was somewhat hesitant to make the purchase, because I always think twice before spending, this looked like a good opportunity and good timing. I contacted the seller by email.</p>
<p>First I asked for the production date on the gun. I wanted to upgrade the trigger using an Apex trigger kit. After some google-fu I determined that, most likely, pre-September 2010 guns had the older 1/16th inch sear plunger and sear spring in the sear housing block. After that date, they changed the size to 1/8 inch. I needed to buy the newer model to avoid even more cost in upgrading the trigger. The seller said the production date was December 2013.</p>
<p>I emailed back and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m interested. I have a NC concealed carry permit. I&#8217;m in Myrtle Beach today and will be driving back to Raleigh tomorrow. I can route through Wilmington but I&#8217;d want to shoot the pistol. I have factory ammo in 115gr. 10 rounds through each magazine is sufficient. Are you available tomorrow and is there a range where we could meet?&#8221; I included my cell number.</p>
<p>Part of me was hoping the seller would refuse to let me shoot the gun. Then I could walk away from the deal and still have my cash. I wouldn&#8217;t buy a used car without driving it and I didn&#8217;t want to buy a used gun without shooting it. He was very reasonable. He offered two options: a local indoor range or his parent&#8217;s house. I let him pick. The fact that he offered to meet me at an indoor range made me feel safer, but I didn&#8217;t want the additional cost and potential wait time if we met at the indoor range. I agreed to meet him on Sunday afternoon at his parent&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>I emailed my friend with the M&amp;P CORE and let him know all the details: the seller&#8217;s name, cell #, email address and where we were planning to meet. When I left the beach I told my mom I was stopping on the way home to &#8220;see a man about a gun&#8221;. I was excited and scared.</p>
<p>I had packed: eyes &amp; ears, my uplula loader, a box of Remington factory ammo, some IPDA targets, and an envelope with $425 in cash. I was wearing a high necked shirt. I punched the address into the GPS and hit the road.</p>
<p>Around 2pm, I turned off the highway at the address listed. It was a dirt road. I figured that might be the case if I was going to shoot. I drove past a building that looked abandoned. It had a sign that said &#8220;Upholstery&#8221; on it. The dirt road kept going around a corner and into a pine forest. I briefly thought this might not be a good idea, but if it went wrong, at least someone new the details.</p>
<p>I finally came around a corner and saw a house. Unlike the shop I passed, it was in good repair. A tall, lean man was walking through the yard holding a toddler. This was isolated but didn&#8217;t look threatening. I got out of the car. I told him who I was looking for and he told me that was his brother. He&#8217;d been delayed and was on the way. After a 15 minute wait and some laughs at the antics of the toddler, the seller came driving up the driveway.</p>
<p>Things went very smoothly.</p>
<ul>
<li>I asked if he minded putting on the small backstrap. He did that for me.</li>
<li>I asked if he was OK letting me field strip the pistol. He looked a bit surprised but said he was fine with that. I could tell the pistol had been shot but the feed ramp had some shine to it. It came apart and went back together with no issues.</li>
<li>I asked where I could shoot the pistol and he pointed me to a huge pile of wood chips. He asked if I wanted to judge the accuracy and I said yes. He said he&#8217;d go look for some cardboard but I pulled out an IDPA target. He propped it up in the wood chip pile while I loaded magazines.</li>
<li>My friend happened to call to check on me and the seller heard me say, I&#8221;m getting ready to shoot the gun now. I&#8217;ll call you when I&#8217;m done.&#8221; I did want him to know I was checking in with someone.</li>
<li>The pistol shot flawlessly. I collected the target.</li>
<li>I told him I was happy with what I saw and wanted to buy it. He pulled out a form he&#8217;d downloaded from the internet. I found it <a href="http://www.billofsale-template.com/gun-bill-of-sale.">here</a>. He filled out two copies. We each kept one.</li>
<li>He asked to see my driver&#8217;s license and CCW. I asked to see his and asked to take a photo of each with my cell phone. He wrote in the DL # for the buyer and the seller. I read through the form and signed. He said he never put names on the form. I verified the DL # he listed for himself matched what was on his DL.</li>
<li>I gave him the envelop with the cash.</li>
</ul>
<p>We chatted a bit about IDPA, concealed carry (he showed me his), and what he was now shooting (a Glock). I got in my car and headed home.</p>
<p>I called my friend to let him know I was safe, I&#8217;d was on the road driving and that <strong>I&#8217;d bought the pistol!</strong>. We talked about upgrades after I got home.</p>
<p>I called my gunsmith on Monday and told him I&#8217;d bought a gun. He replied, &#8220;Uh oh, what did you buy?&#8221; followed by &#8220;How much did you pay?&#8221; He told me I&#8217;d gotten a really good deal assuming it was in good shape. Time will tell, but I wanted to document the experience. I&#8217;m pretty excited about the new gun.</p>
<p>I found magazines under $25 apiece, with free shipping, at<a href="https://www.armsunlimited.com/Smith-Wesson-SW-MP-9mm-17-Round-Pistol-Magazine-p/19440.htm"> Arms Unlimited</a>.I placed the order Monday night and they arrive Thursday evening. They were S&amp;W magazines, not aftermarket knock offs.</p>
<p>Next is a holster and magazine pouches.Then the Apex Trigger Kit. And possibly an extended magazine release. And, of course, much, much more practice.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Paul, Thanks!</p>
<p>So far I picked up 6 additional magazines from Arms Unlimited for $24.95 each. Free Shipping.<br />
Link here: <a href="http://www.armsunlimited.com/Smith-Wesson-SW-MP-9mm-17-Round-Pistol-Magazine-p/19440.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.armsunlimited.com/Smith-Wesson-SW-MP-9mm-17-Round-Pistol-Magazine-p/19440.htm</a><br />
The free shipping was fast. I think I had them in 3-4 days. They are not aftermarket, they are S&#038;W magazines. </p>
<p>Then I ordered an extended magazine release. Here are the details: <a href="http://21cg.us/shop/index.php/catalyst/m-p-catalyst-pre-order-special.html" rel="nofollow">http://21cg.us/shop/index.php/catalyst/m-p-catalyst-pre-order-special.html</a><br />
although I ordered it from Brownell&#8217;s. I will install that this weekend. Then I may get a friend to ground it down just a bit to avoid popping out the magazines on a table start. </p>
<p>I have a kydex holster and mag pouches ordered from a local supplier and should have then the weekend before Christmas. Then I can start working on dry fire with my draw. </p>
<p>The Trigger Kit is definitely something I&#8217;m considering. Another friend put one in his gun. He also put in the curved polymer trigger initially, but recently decided to try the newer Flat faced trigger that is more like a 1911 found here <a href="https://store.apextactical.com/WebDirect/Products/Details/191834" rel="nofollow">https://store.apextactical.com/WebDirect/Products/Details/191834</a>. He likes that setup on his gun best.</p>
<p>I seem to have lucked out and gotten a trigger that was done right or well broken in as I have no complaints about what came with the gun. I will compare what I have with the gun that now has a flat faced trigger and I would like to compare what I have versus what you&#8217;ve done with yours, so thank you and I&#8217;d love to take you up on the offer next time we are both at a match.<br />

<p>Sorry I didn&#8217;t speak at the BUG match yesterday. Seems we were both busy before the match. Will make up for that in the future and say hello.</p>

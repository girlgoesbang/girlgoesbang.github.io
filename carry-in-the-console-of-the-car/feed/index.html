		<description><![CDATA[Link works! I haven&#039;t been keeping up with the blog (bad me!) but I did purchase one of these for myself for Christmas: GunVault NV300 NanoVault with Combination Lock (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003841ZBS/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

It will fit my full sized 1911... if it was actually working at the moment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for reading! My car has a trunk, but getting out of the car to un-holster and stash a gun just doesn&#039;t still well with me. I want a place to stash the gun and prevent theft that is still inside the car. I will double check local laws after reading your post. It&#039;s great that you have a supportive spouse! I&#039;m learning / doing this solo and there are times I wish I had a &quot;live in&quot; mentor or supporter. On the flip side, &quot;my house, my rules&quot; and I&#039;m glad I have that option.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[just found your blog &#038; I like your approach.  I surprised myself a year ago (Feb 2013) when  I decided to get a handgun. At the time it was something my husband &#038; I could do together. (due to crazy professional schedules, we are usually apart most of every day &#038; many nights too.) But after I got my CCP I found out I LOVED.My.Gun.  It was &quot;my baby&quot;. We were inseperable. (still are.)  If I am dressed &#038; outside my house, she&#039;s with me; if I am inside my house, she&#039;s within arm&#039;s reach at all times, waking or sleeping.

That being said- I almost never leave my gun in the car. For one thing, our weather here tends to extremes &#038; I&#039;d be unsure how reliably it&#039;d function after spending 2 hours or more in heat or cold.  found THAT out the hard way when I first qualified! gun was cold (keeping it open &#038;ready on the range awaiting my turn to fire), ammo was warm (in my pocket in a reloader). Did not work well!! ...also, while theft isn&#039;t a big problem here it does happen, &#038; it has happened to me. Didn&#039;t lose a gun- just my purse - but I&#039;d hate to lose my baby.

There are very few times I actually go into a place where my handgun is not allowed. In my state, those darn &quot;no firearms allowed here&quot; signs do have legal weight &#038; must be respected. I try hard to just avoid those establishments but it isn&#039;t always possible. I do have a small metal case that locks with a combination, &#038; I can cable it to the body of the car. I used to cable it to the frame below the driver&#039;s seat - it made stowing &#038; retrieval so easy - BUT a Sheriff told me that was bad. Law enforcement would see that as easy access for me to put them in danger! so - on the 3-5 times a year when I have to travel into a state that doesn&#039;t respect my permit, I (legally) put the gun into the lockbox, cable it to the frame of the REAR storage compartment (my car has no trunk, it&#039;s all one big happy inside area),  and thence inside the spare tire compartment. You&#039;d have to know where to look, cut the cable, &#038; decode the combination to get at my baby.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just a quick note.. was reading someone&#039;s posts about traveling with firearms.. this (or something similar) is what they used.

http://www.cabelas.com/product/Bulldog-CarPersonal-Vault/1314481.uts?Ntk=Product_liberal&#038;searchPath=%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch%2F%3FN%3D%26No%3D20%26Ntk%3DProduct_liberal%26Ntt%3Dlock%2Bbox%26Ntx%3Dmode%252Bmatchallpartial%26WTz_l%3DHeader%253BSearch-All%2BProducts%26WTz_st%3D%26WTz_stype%3DSP%26form_state%3DsearchForm%26isLiberal%3DY%26recordsPerPage%3D20%26search%3Dlock%2Bbox%26searchTypeByFilter%3DAllProducts%26x%3D0%26y%3D0&#038;Ntt=lock+box

 I hope the link works.. if not, it&#039;s a Bulldog car/personal vault. Comes with a cable to attach it to a hard point in the car. Not the best thing out there, I suppose, but reasonably priced. 

 Haven&#039;t shot in forever.. how about you? :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like your thinking. At one time I used to buy guns just because I liked them. Got to be very expensive and required a lot of gun safes. Now all my guns work. I have both semi auto and revolver pocket guns. The same for my belt guns and the same for my home defense guns. I have guns for the car and NAA Mini revolvers for my bathing suit, BUG or sticking into nooks and crannies. I have guns for all manner of clothes. All my guns get carried at some time or do duty in one of four handgun safes scattered about the house.]]></description>

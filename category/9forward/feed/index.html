				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For most of the last year I&#8217;ve shot one of my guns at least once a week. I bought a gold membership at PDHSC and while that was in effect, it was an easy decision to go to the range and shoot. I&#8217;d limit myself to 100 rounds most visits and I&#8217;d be there about an hour.For some months I had a shooting partner and we would discuss drills and ideas, but most of those trips were solo.</p>
<p>During that time I&#8217;ve come along way with my gun handling skills and safety awareness. I remember early on when I&#8217;d pick up a magazine and I&#8217;d have to puzzle out which direction it should face when I put it in the gun. That is now something I don&#8217;t question.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve shot competitions and I&#8217;m past the point of nerves and adrenaline. I&#8217;m reasonably competent but I&#8217;m not a competitive shooter. But that isn&#8217;t improving.</p>
<p>With the expiration of my gold membership, I&#8217;ve decided to rethink how I&#8217;m spending my &#8220;gun time&#8221;. Continuing to put lead downrange is fun, but I&#8217;m not convinced I&#8217;m structuring my range time to be productive.</p>
<p>Also, with the purchase of the XDS, I want to get comfortable with carrying a gun other than at the range and at a competition. That is what prompted the last post in carrying in the car &#8212; and I appreciate all the feedback on why I should not leave the gun in the car permanently.</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_20130714_191834sm.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-826" alt="IMG_20130714_191834sm" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_20130714_191834sm.jpg" width="450" height="596" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_20130714_191834sm.jpg 450w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_20130714_191834sm-226x300.jpg 226w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>I bought a Remora Concealment Holster and intend to start carrying it around the house with the gun unloaded at first just to see how this works. It has a rigid opening and doesn&#8217;t collapse when the gun is drawn, it has a flap to make it &#8220;tuckable&#8221;, there is a clip but it can be removed (it snaps on), and it&#8217;s a &#8220;sticky&#8221; holster. I tried it on in the store at 9Forward and it felt comfortable.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;ve drawn from it and it&#8217;s very different from the dropped, offset holsters I&#8217;ve been using for competition. It was at this point that I realized that I might want to switch my focus from &#8220;getting better at competition&#8221; to &#8220;getting better at self-defense&#8221;. I&#8217;m not going to be able to conceal a dropped offset holster unless it&#8217;s a very cold day and I have no plans to remove my coat, so I think I need to suck it up and start working with the equipment that is practical for everyday carry &#8212; even if it&#8217;s not designed with the easy access of a competition holster.</p>

<p>The evolution of buying a gun:</p>
<ul>
<li>I saw <a href="http://www.triangletactical.net/2013/06/04/springfield-xds-9mm-review-first-impressions/">this post</a> Tuesday morning,</li>
<li>exchanged a few emails with Luke in which he said &#8220;a little bird told him they would have another XDS in 9mm on Thursday,</li>
<li>called <a href="http://carolinagunrunners.com/">Carolina Gunrunners</a> Tuesday afternoon and asked about availability,</li>
<li>drove over after work and paid for the gun with a credit card (note that they do not take credit cards over the phone for liability reasons but they charge the same price for cash or credit)</li>
<li>got a call Thursday morning to let me know the gun was in and would be ready for pick up at my convenience, and</li>
<li>drove back to <a href="http://carolinagunrunners.com/">Carolina Gunrunners</a> last night after work, filled out the paperwork and brought home my purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luke at <a href="http://www.triangletactical.net/">Triangle Tactical</a> has also written a review of his first experience shooting the gun. <a href="http://www.triangletactical.net/2013/06/05/first-shots-through-the-springfield-xds-9mm/">Read that here</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited about this purchase and will have much more to say about it. I have plans to shoot it tomorrow. But for now this odd tidbit: it&#8217;s the smallest gun I&#8217;ve purchased to date and it came in the biggest box. I like that it&#8217;s rugged but it&#8217;s going to take up lots of space to store it.</p>
<p>In the photo above, you&#8217;ll see the gun comes with: a paddle holster, a smaller backstrap, a double mag pouch, a gun lock, the XDS, two 7 round magazines, and replacement red dot and green dot site rods.</p>
<p>The red dot/green dot rods are completely new to me so I asked about them. The fellow at Carolina Gunrunners told me that if the existing red dot site broke, I could slide a replacement rod into the site, cut it then take a cigarette lighter and melt the ends. This gun will clearly jump start me into learning new things.</p>
<p>If you want to purchase the XDS in 9mm, Carolina Gunrunners in north Raleigh will have more being shipped to the store. I found them very easy to work with and would not hesitate to do business with them again in the future.</p>
<p>I also got a call from Rachel at <a href="../9forward-opening-day/">9Forward</a> on Wednesday. She remembered that I had asked about the XDS when I was in the store for their opening and she called to let me know they had started receiving shipments. So if you are closer to Oxford and Raleigh is a long drive for you, this is another place locally that you can buy this gun now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I realized I was not getting notifications of comments when I had visitors to the blog. I got on the phone with my hosting company last night and got that sorted out. I appreciate all comments and I apologize for being slow to respond this spring. I should be much more responsive in the future.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been shooting as much recently due to a change in employment. I was with my previous employer just shy of 8 years. I found shooting and explored shooting pistol matches all while working for that employer. My co-workers were gun friendly and I got to the point of taking that for granted. I haven&#8217;t opted to bring up the topic of guns with my new co-workers. Yet. That may be a future topic for the blog.</p>

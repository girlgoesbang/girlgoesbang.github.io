<p>I&#8217;m a pistol shooter. I have very little experience with any other type of weapon. I recently posted an ad online looking for a partner to shoot defensive pistol matches. Why? I found that most male shooters are polite to single women shooters, but I wouldn&#8217;t call them welcoming. Possibly I&#8217;m considered a threat to someone&#8217;s marriage, I&#8217;m not sure. But it&#8217;s fairly boring going to a match for 4+ hours and not really engaging with anyone at more than an impersonal level. So to make it more compelling for me to shoot matches, I made an attempt at recruiting partner(s) through my extended network.</p>
<p>A total stranger popped up in response to the ad, and I ended up shooting an AR-15 out the second story window of his house at the backstop in his yard within two weeks. IT WAS A BLAST!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as crazy as it sounds. We have a mutual friend that vouched for him. I met him for dinner before driving to his house. Part of the conversation included him asking me if this was a passing phase or if I was serious about shooting. Fair enough. I liked his direct approach.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t share his background without his permission but we started by talking about range safety then shot pistols in his backyard into the backstop he&#8217;d built. He helped me understand &#8220;natural point of aim&#8221; a bit better and had me do some drills drawing from the holster and shooting the target with my eyes closed. After 6 or 8 shots I had a nice pattern &#8212; all about 12 inches to the right of the target. After a bit more observation he told me I was pushing the gun to the right when I added my support hand. This is something I&#8217;d like to work on more. When crazy things start to happen, it&#8217;s most likely I&#8217;ll point shoot. So I&#8217;d like to build that skill.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s more of a long gun kind of guy and offered to let me shoot one of his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15">AR-15s</a>. I brought some .223 rounds and we shot them all.</p>

<p>Details:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">Range: 55 yards</span></li>
<li>Direction: from the 2nd floor of the house down into the backstop</li>
<li>I shot from benchrest</li>
<li>I used a scope</li>
</ul>
<p>We shot targets. He had paint balls so we propped them up on the target with thumb tacks and shot the paint balls. They go SPLAT! very nicely. I nailed 3 in a row on my first attempt and giggled like a kid. And as you can see, we shot coins too. I really wanted a souvenir.</p>
<p>I pretty sure there there is a 3 gun match in my future. If I wasn&#8217;t replacing the transmission in my car this week I&#8217;d be out shopping for AR-15 components.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not exactly sure if I&#8217;ve found a defensive pistol match partner, but I did have a great experience and if nothing else, I may have picked up yet another expensive hobby.</p>

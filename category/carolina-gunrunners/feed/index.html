<p>The evolution of buying a gun:</p>
<ul>
<li>I saw <a href="http://www.triangletactical.net/2013/06/04/springfield-xds-9mm-review-first-impressions/">this post</a> Tuesday morning,</li>
<li>exchanged a few emails with Luke in which he said &#8220;a little bird told him they would have another XDS in 9mm on Thursday,</li>
<li>called <a href="http://carolinagunrunners.com/">Carolina Gunrunners</a> Tuesday afternoon and asked about availability,</li>
<li>drove over after work and paid for the gun with a credit card (note that they do not take credit cards over the phone for liability reasons but they charge the same price for cash or credit)</li>
<li>got a call Thursday morning to let me know the gun was in and would be ready for pick up at my convenience, and</li>
<li>drove back to <a href="http://carolinagunrunners.com/">Carolina Gunrunners</a> last night after work, filled out the paperwork and brought home my purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luke at <a href="http://www.triangletactical.net/">Triangle Tactical</a> has also written a review of his first experience shooting the gun. <a href="http://www.triangletactical.net/2013/06/05/first-shots-through-the-springfield-xds-9mm/">Read that here</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited about this purchase and will have much more to say about it. I have plans to shoot it tomorrow. But for now this odd tidbit: it&#8217;s the smallest gun I&#8217;ve purchased to date and it came in the biggest box. I like that it&#8217;s rugged but it&#8217;s going to take up lots of space to store it.</p>
<p>In the photo above, you&#8217;ll see the gun comes with: a paddle holster, a smaller backstrap, a double mag pouch, a gun lock, the XDS, two 7 round magazines, and replacement red dot and green dot site rods.</p>
<p>The red dot/green dot rods are completely new to me so I asked about them. The fellow at Carolina Gunrunners told me that if the existing red dot site broke, I could slide a replacement rod into the site, cut it then take a cigarette lighter and melt the ends. This gun will clearly jump start me into learning new things.</p>
<p>If you want to purchase the XDS in 9mm, Carolina Gunrunners in north Raleigh will have more being shipped to the store. I found them very easy to work with and would not hesitate to do business with them again in the future.</p>
<p>I also got a call from Rachel at <a href="../9forward-opening-day/">9Forward</a> on Wednesday. She remembered that I had asked about the XDS when I was in the store for their opening and she called to let me know they had started receiving shipments. So if you are closer to Oxford and Raleigh is a long drive for you, this is another place locally that you can buy this gun now.</p>

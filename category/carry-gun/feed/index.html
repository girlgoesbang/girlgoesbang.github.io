I wanted to know more about carry options for women so I volunteered. I bought a holster (discounted for the models) and then walked in the show.</p>
<p>I got a first hand report on all the holsters as I had time to talk to the models backstage about how they liked each of the options they would be showing. I have one or two new items added to my future shopping list as a result.</p>
<p>There were news crews onsite and two versions were aired. I managed to get a copy of each though the shorter version is not the greatest quality. I&#8217;m the one trying not to smile in the pink shirt. </p>
<p>The event included vendors, speakers and the fashion show. Food was available at the venue. A knife fighting demo was also included. Several guns were raffled off with the proceeds (over $2000) donated to the Rape Crisis Volunteers of Cumberland County. </p>
<p>I intend to write more but for now here&#8217;s the video. Enjoy!</p>

<p>When I buy something, I like to use it. I&#8217;m up to four 9mm pistols at this point and I&#8217;m going through a process of deciding where each &#8220;fits&#8221; in my life &#8212; or whether to sell one of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve parked the H&amp;K in my bedroom. It&#8217;s the only gun I have with night sights.</li>
<li>When I bought the 1911 it replaced the XD9 as my competition gun (for now). I tried putting the XD9 in the car, but I wanted it in the center console. It&#8217;s too big. I can&#8217;t really reach the glove box quickly but I can pop the center console and access items next to me fast. So the XD9 went back in my range bag as a back up competition gun.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have  a CCW but I haven&#8217;t gotten comfortable carrying a loaded gun on my body outside of the range or competitions. So I decided my next baby step would be to carry in the car.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been reading you know I bought the XDS in 9mm. It&#8217;s a perfect fit for the glove box. I took the holster that came with the gun and attached it to a heavy CD case (metallic blue with a zipper in the photo) using a rubber band in order to test out the concept. The holster keeps the gun upright and centered. The CD case keeps the holster in place when I draw the gun. I practice drawing at least once a day now and I&#8217;m happy with this system. I just want to find something more reliable than a rubber band to make it work.</p>
<p>The next time I&#8217;m at The Range and it&#8217;s fairly empty and dry, I will try driving my car out into a bay and practice a S L O W draw with a transition to shoot through the driver&#8217;s window and or passenger window.</p>
<p>At this point I have questions. So if you are reading and you are willing to share:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">Do you carry in your car? Why or why not? </span></li>
<li>Where do you carry?</li>
<li>Do you leave the gun in the car full time or remove it once you are home?</li>
</ul>
<p>I have many conversations with shooters but never with a consistent mentor and this is the kind of thing I will figure out on my own, but would really like pointers.</p>

<p>The evolution of buying a gun:</p>
<ul>
<li>I saw <a href="http://www.triangletactical.net/2013/06/04/springfield-xds-9mm-review-first-impressions/">this post</a> Tuesday morning,</li>
<li>exchanged a few emails with Luke in which he said &#8220;a little bird told him they would have another XDS in 9mm on Thursday,</li>
<li>called <a href="http://carolinagunrunners.com/">Carolina Gunrunners</a> Tuesday afternoon and asked about availability,</li>
<li>drove over after work and paid for the gun with a credit card (note that they do not take credit cards over the phone for liability reasons but they charge the same price for cash or credit)</li>
<li>got a call Thursday morning to let me know the gun was in and would be ready for pick up at my convenience, and</li>
<li>drove back to <a href="http://carolinagunrunners.com/">Carolina Gunrunners</a> last night after work, filled out the paperwork and brought home my purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luke at <a href="http://www.triangletactical.net/">Triangle Tactical</a> has also written a review of his first experience shooting the gun. <a href="http://www.triangletactical.net/2013/06/05/first-shots-through-the-springfield-xds-9mm/">Read that here</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited about this purchase and will have much more to say about it. I have plans to shoot it tomorrow. But for now this odd tidbit: it&#8217;s the smallest gun I&#8217;ve purchased to date and it came in the biggest box. I like that it&#8217;s rugged but it&#8217;s going to take up lots of space to store it.</p>
<p>In the photo above, you&#8217;ll see the gun comes with: a paddle holster, a smaller backstrap, a double mag pouch, a gun lock, the XDS, two 7 round magazines, and replacement red dot and green dot site rods.</p>
<p>The red dot/green dot rods are completely new to me so I asked about them. The fellow at Carolina Gunrunners told me that if the existing red dot site broke, I could slide a replacement rod into the site, cut it then take a cigarette lighter and melt the ends. This gun will clearly jump start me into learning new things.</p>
<p>If you want to purchase the XDS in 9mm, Carolina Gunrunners in north Raleigh will have more being shipped to the store. I found them very easy to work with and would not hesitate to do business with them again in the future.</p>
<p>I also got a call from Rachel at <a href="../9forward-opening-day/">9Forward</a> on Wednesday. She remembered that I had asked about the XDS when I was in the store for their opening and she called to let me know they had started receiving shipments. So if you are closer to Oxford and Raleigh is a long drive for you, this is another place locally that you can buy this gun now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sunday I agreed to go shooting with a friend I haven&#8217;t seen since I before I started shooting. He saw me on the news in an <a href="../voila-i-am-a-dancing-bear/">interview</a> done by the local station and he reached out. I never feel I spend enough time at the range and I didn&#8217;t want to give up my structured practices to hang out with someone I wasn&#8217;t even sure was safe with guns&#8230; so I procrastinated.</p>
<p>Bad girl! Other than dealing with the chaos that is becoming normal on the weekend at a gun range, I had a good time. He has a nice collection of Springfield Armory guns. I let him shoot my 1911. Until I had to admit that my XD9 was really too wide for my hand, I loved that gun. It&#8217;s simple to use, reliable, and simple to clean. I shot a .40 and .45 caliber pistol for the first time. Very manageable.</p>
<p>I bought a 1911 with a 5&#8243; barrel to replace the XD9 as my competition gun but haven&#8217;t yet bought a carry gun because there are just too many decisions to make and I don&#8217;t want to buy a gun I don&#8217;t end up liking and that I have not shot.</p>
<p>I walked away from shooting with my friend with a slam dunk of a choice. He has a Springfield XD-S in .45 calibre. It&#8217;s small, it&#8217;s thin, and it&#8217;s an XD! It&#8217;s a bruiser to shoot but I felt that with practice I could manage it nicely. It never jammed for him. It did jam for me, but I think I must have been limp-wristing the gun.</p>
<p>I made a decision early on that I wasn&#8217;t going to buy any more guns unless they were in 9mm. I don&#8217;t want to have to stock up on multiple calibers. My life, my decision.</p>
<p>Word from the SHOT show is that Springfield will be producing this gun in 9mm in the spring. I want this one. Easy, easy decision. To make it even easier, holsters should already be available as the .45 holsters should also fit the 9mm model. Win!</p>
<p>Now, I need to figure out how to get on a list somewhere to order this as I get the impression it will be popular.</p>
<p>For my reference, here is a review:<br />

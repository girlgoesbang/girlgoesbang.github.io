I started my day with a snow covered car. And a commitment to pick up a holster and 3 mag pouches from the local guy (<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/d-dholsters.com/store/">D&amp;D Holsters</a>) I bought them from last year. My house was burglarized last fall, most of my shooting gear was stolen and I was in the process of rebuilding. This was the last bit of equipment I needed to shoot my next match. The forecast predicted that the snow wouldn&#8217;t stick and my holster would be ready for pickup at noon, so I took a broom to the car to remove the snow and I headed north to <a href="http://www.the-range.com/">The Range</a> in Oxford.</p>
<p>I had no intention of shooting a match. Really. There was snow on the ground! I think the last match I shot was back in May of 2016. I needed to practice with the new gun and the new holsters. I wasn&#8217;t sure I even remembered how to do a reload on the clock.</p>
<p>But an hour later I arrived and the weather had turned beautiful. It was 50 degrees and warm in the sun. I ran into friends I hadn&#8217;t seen in months. Everyone of them encouraged me to shoot. The holster I picked up fit the gun with a minor adjustment and the mag pouches were perfect with no adjustment.</p>
<p>I was short on ammo since I was sure it would be much too cold for to shoot. A friend filled that gap and said he&#8217;d give me what I needed if I ran short.</p>
<ul>
<li>Was I ready to compete? No.</li>
<li>Was all my gear the way I wanted it it? No.</li>
<li>Was my gear sufficient? Yes.</li>
<li>Could I be safe? Yes.</li>
</ul>
<p>I sighed up and shot the match. I was a good decision. Thanks to everyone who badgered me into it!</p>
<p>I had chosen a down vest that morning due to the cold so this was my first match using a down vest as a cover garment. It worked fine.</p>
<p>I remembered what I liked best about shooting a match: spending time with friends. I&#8217;m not competitive. I always place near the bottom of the list. But I really enjoy the sport and I&#8217;m a safe.shooter. They asked me to help out with scoring so I pitched in and did that as well. Once the match was over I checked in with the guys who were running the timer to get feedback on how we worked together. I&#8217;m glad I did. I&#8217;ll be able to do the job better when I&#8217;m asked again.</p>
<p>The timer keeper is responsible for ensuring no one wanders into the line of fire as well as recording the time, the points down and any penalties. I was focused on the scoring part of that list. I was aware of where the rest of the squad was subconsciously but I&#8217;ll be looking more actively to keep other shooters safe if/when asked to help again.</p>
<p>We shot moving targets, we moved and shot stationary targets, we shot both paper &amp; steel, we shot through walls and had to back down a hallway and make a right to get yet more &#8220;bad guys&#8221; (targets) in the shoot house. It was sunny and warm. It was absolutely a good decision to participate. It was an excellent day.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on making peace with my poor scores and enjoying the good parts of the day. Like the triple hit I made on a target from my first stage (above). The requirement was 3 shots per target. This was at t 15 yards, I think. That&#8217;s a sweet grouping and really made me smile. I have much to work on but I&#8217;m really thrilled when I see results like this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I took a defensive shooting / beginner competition class last October. The instructor insisted my gun did not fit my hands well. I really liked that gun (Springfield XD9) but I agreed. The same reasons are spelled out in these blog posts:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the Cornered Cat: &#8220;<a href="http://www.corneredcat.com/big/">Big</a>&#8221; excerpt: &#8220;When a handgun is too large for you, <em>it does not mean you cannot shoot the gun at all.</em> Obviously, you can! And you can enjoy it, too. But a self-defense gun should fit your hand as perfectly as possible.&#8221;</li>
<li>From When the Balloon Goes up: &#8220;<a href="http://www.balloongoesup.com/blog/how-to-know-if-a-pistol-is-too-big-or-too-small/">How to know if a pistol is too big (or too small)</a>&#8220;</li>
</ul>
<div>I don&#8217;t like to spend money. I set financial goals for myself and a buffer that will let me ride out multiple months of unemployment is a requirement in my life. I rode the dot.com boom and bust in San Francisco for 10 years. That buffer helps me sleep at night.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The instructor recommended I purchase a 1911. If I couldn&#8217;t afford that, I should look at a S&amp;W M&amp;P 9. I&#8217;m very invested in learning to shoot well, so after agonizing over the decision, I opted to look at the 1911 options. Then I had to shop for one. For competition I wanted a 5&#8243;&#8216; barrel (more accurate) in 9mm (more affordable to shoot). I looked a local shops, online, asked friends about options and, about a month later I  snatched up the S&amp;W 1911 in 9mm that appeared in the shop where I normally shoot. I paid cash to save about $40 in credit card fees.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div id="attachment_460" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSCN0874-sm.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-460" title="DSCN0874-sm" src="http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSCN0874-sm-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSCN0874-sm-300x199.jpg 300w, http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSCN0874-sm-450x300.jpg 450w, http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSCN0874-sm.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Brand new 1911</p></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here&#8217;s the total so far to switch to the new gun:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>$1290 &#8211;  for the gun and 2 magazines</li>
<li>    $90 &#8211;  1 Holster in green by Daranich Tactical (offset and dropped)</li>
<li>    $70 &#8211;  2 mag carriers in green by Daranich Tactical (offset)</li>
<li>  $129 &#8211;  3 additional Wilson Combat magazines (for a total of 5)</li>
<li>    $80 &#8211; 4 hour class on complete take down for a 1911</li>
<li>   $90 &#8211;  specialized cleaning tools and supplies from the take down class</li>
<li>  $156 &#8211; new grips, installed + two tools for take down + A Wilson Combat Take down Manual</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Total: $1905</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div id="attachment_461" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSCN1005-sm.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-461" title="DSCN1005-sm" src="http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSCN1005-sm-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSCN1005-sm-300x225.jpg 300w, http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSCN1005-sm-400x300.jpg 400w, http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSCN1005-sm.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">All the new gear.</p></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I also spent $80 on a dropped offset holster for my Springfield XD9 to use until I got the 1911 purchases sorted out and $75 on a Woolrich Concealment vest. That brought my total expenditures, ignoring ammunition, to $2060 for October/November of 2012.</div>
<p><div>It took about 6 weeks to get the slim and get them installed. I basically had to start over learning to draw and to work the gun (because of the safety). I shot matches in late July, mid-September, and late October with my XD9. Due to these purchase and the new learning curve I didn&#8217;t shoot another match until January.</div>
</p>
<p><div>I haven&#8217;t taken any further classes and won&#8217;t until I can replace the cash I spent to switch guns. I still practice or shoot about once a week but no private or group lessons for now.</div>
<div>Was it a good decision? I&#8217;m not sure.</div>
<p><div><strong>The down side:</strong> This gun is very finicky. The safety requires thinking about even more new things. It malfunctions easier. I have wasted lots of time at matches figuring out what&#8217;s wrong with my gun.</div>
<p><div><strong>The upside:</strong> It&#8217;s thinner.<a href="http://girlgoesbang.com/holding-on-1911-vs-xd9/"> More importantly, it&#8217;s heavier</a>. I&#8217;m now able to shoot without re-positioning my hands on the gun between shots. When I&#8217;m ready to start shooting faster, the reduced recoil will help. The trigger is much lighter. I&#8217;m starting to take that for granted but it has surprised the friends that have shot this gun.</div>
<p><div>For now: I&#8217;m determined to learn as much as I can. I&#8217;m going to shoot with this gun for the rest of this year and then decide if I should be looking for something else.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last competition match I shot almost cost me a holster. The day after the match I dumped out my range bag and was doing a quick inventory when I noticed: no kydex holster for the XD. That was bad, very bad. The holster set me back $80 and I really, really did not want to buy another one.</p>
<p>I was headed back to the shop for a class that afternoon so I went early. I checked out the room where we hung out between stages and where I&#8217;d packed up my gear. The table was pristine and clean. My heart sunk.</p>
<p>A couple was filling out forms, probably their first visit to the range. I was looking through every box and container around them when the gentleman asked, &#8220;Are you looking for something?&#8221;. I explained and he glanced into a large box on the floor next to him that contained VHS tapes and was labeled, &#8220;Free &#8211; Please take&#8221;. He said, &#8220;Is this want you are looking for?&#8221; The cynic in me thought he was messing with me, but hallelujah!. He picked up my holster and I gave him a huge grin. I told him he&#8217;d made me a very happy girl. I must have knocked it off the table when I was packing up.</p>
<p>Lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay attention</li>
<li>Label your gear so that an honest person will know who to return it too</li>
</ul>
<div>Tonight I did just that:</div>
<div id="attachment_141" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0832-Copy1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-141 " title="DSCN0832 - Copy" src="http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0832-Copy1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="283" srcset="http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0832-Copy1.jpg 350w, http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0832-Copy1-300x242.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">All gear labeled! Hopefully I won&#8217;t misplace anything again but if I do there is hope for it to be returned.</p></div>
<p>Included: belt, ear muffs, custom ear plugs, 4 holsters, 3 mag pouches, glasses, and 3 sets of magazines.</p>
<p>I also numbered the individual magazines. An instructor advised me to do that. Why? If you start having problems with a magazine you can tell if it&#8217;s always the same one or if it&#8217;s randoms (ie: an issue with the gun).</p>
<p>And yes, I know using a label maker is kind of nerdy, but I really like the results. It will be interesting to see how the labels wear and if they stay attached to the gear. I have a small concern that the magazine labels will be scraped off when I load then stick in the magazine well, but that easy enough to fix. Each set has the labels in a different location so I can see what works best.</p>

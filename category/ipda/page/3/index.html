			<p>A local blog wrote about drawing before you move at competitive matches:<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.triangletactical.net/2013/03/26/2-bug-matches-idpa-and-a-girl-goes-bang-ttp-ep-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 BUG Matches, IDPA, and a Girl Goes Bang – TTP – Ep. 20</a> </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #000000;">said:</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Tip of The Week:</h3>
<p>Draw, then move. It’s almost never a good idea in a match to move to a position, then draw the pistol. Ben goes into detail about why this is the case.</p></blockquote>
<p>They also gave a &#8220;Plug of the Week&#8221; top my blog. Since I&#8217;ve been blogging less time than I&#8217;ve been shooting, that really made my week. On the podcast they mentioned that I brought up issues encountered by new shooters. So here&#8217;s the new shooter version of shooting on the move.</p>
<p><strong>Stage description:</strong><br />
Magazines were loaded 6,6,10.<br />
Stage was a single shot to each of 6 targets:<br />
1) while moving sideways, then stop and slidelock reload<br />
2) while moving forward, then stop and slidelock reload<br />
3) while moving <a id="_GPLITA_0" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Coupon Companion Plugin" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9WxHPmlmrs#">backward</a><br />
for a total of 3 shots to each target.<br />
(From <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #000000;">March 10, 2013 IDPA match at The Range in Oxford, NC &#8211; Stage 6)</span></p>
<p>Listen closely and you will hear the RSO say &#8220;Move&#8221; after my draw. I&#8217;m thinking so hard about getting the gun on target that I put moving as secondary. This is purely by accident but it&#8217;s nice to know I&#8217;m developing some good habits:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/h9WxHPmlmrs" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Note: This is my first video! One of the guys in my squad was taking a video of another shooter and I asked him about that. He said he&#8217;d take one of me if I had a camera. When we got to this stage he nudged me and told me that this would be a great stage for video because it was so open. I handed him the $50 camera I bought at a <a href="http://www.tradeitstores.com/">Trade It</a> in Raleigh and told him I knew it took video but wasn&#8217;t sure how it worked. Not only did he figure out how to work the camera, he took a short video without extra footage &#8212; which is great because it&#8217;s beyond me to edit video at this point.</p>
<p>Why am I sharing that? Because Ben &amp; Luke are right that the people you shoot with are really nice, really helpful folks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very slow and usually come in dead last, but I&#8217;m learning confidence with safety, what to expect at matches, and making friends. If I stick with it, I am hoping better scores will be in my future.</p>
<p>And here are more thoughts on shooting and moving that I saw this week on another local blog: <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;"><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WhenTheBalloonGoesUp/~3/MVfOG9XtEqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Is shooting on the move a good idea?</a></span></p>

<p>I shot a match in Oxford on March 9, 2013 (my 7th match ever).</p>
<p>I continue to have malfunctions with the 1911. At a previous match one of the guys suggested I might be limp-wristing but I really didn&#8217;t think I was. If so, it would be happening more frequently.  I think everyone felt my frustration as I had magazine malfunctions in two stages: rounds jam at the top and the magazine starts to fall out the bottom.</p>
<p>At this match, one of the RSOs was shooting the exact some gun that I&#8217;m shooting: the S&amp;W 1911 in 9mm. I have slimmer grips but that&#8217;s really the only difference. He stopped to talk with me after the match. He asked if I could be hitting the magazine release? With my small hands I think not but it was a good question to ask on the way to solving the problem.</p>
<p>Then he asked a question I didn&#8217;t expect: How many rounds are you loading in the magazines? Huh? They hold 10 rounds and division capacity is 10 rounds so the obvious answer appeared to be: 10 rounds. Not so&#8230;</p>
<p>He told me he loads 9 rounds in each magazine. These magazines are so tight that having 10 rounds creates too much pressure, causing the slide to drag and &#8220;voila!&#8221; the appearance of limp-wristing. Almost everytime I&#8217;ve had a malfunction it was on the 2nd shot so I think his logic may apply to my situation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m shooting ESP. The consensus was that I could do this. I need to shoot the entire match this way and inform the RSO up front. One of the folks we consulted seemed to think this might be in a gray area as far as the rules, but since I&#8217;m nowhere close to competitive at this point, I don&#8217;t think this will cause anyone any anxiety.</p>
<p>And I want to see if it makes a difference. So the next match, I&#8217;m downloading to 9 rounds and we&#8217;ll see if that reduces the annoying malfunctions.</p>

My GPS found <a href="http://caswellranch.com/">Caswell Ranch</a> with no issues. The website says &#8220;Look for big red dutch barn&#8221; and that was easy to spot from the road.</p>
<p>I was early enough to snap a few pictures, get good parking, register and find the bathrooms.</p>
<p>Beverly signed me in, made me feel welcome, and let me know about future training classes. Dean Brevit wasn&#8217;t there. I think he was at the 2013 IDPA Indoor National Championships. However, many of the men I met at the match mentioned Dean and all had very good things to say about training with him. I plan to attend the <a href="http://caswellranch.com/classes/">FUNDAMENTAL COMPETITION PART 1 &amp; 2 classes</a> once they are posted on the calendar.</p>
<p>And, one of the guys recognized me from this blog! That still seems odd. Most of the guys shooting know so much more than I do.</p>
<div id="attachment_428" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_20130224_131441-sm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-428" title="IMG_20130224_131441-sm" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_20130224_131441-sm1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="317" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_20130224_131441-sm1.jpg 1000w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_20130224_131441-sm1-300x95.jpg 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_20130224_131441-sm1-500x158.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Stage 2: black parts of target are considered cover</p></div>
<p><strong>Stage 2</strong></p>
<p>My squad started on Stage 2. The scenario: see the 6 targets above. The black areas are considered cover and any shots into the black will not be scored. Best I remember, here&#8217;s what we shot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shoot 1 in each target from 10 yards, administrative reload</li>
<li>Shoot 1 in each target, from 7 years, strong hand only, administrative reload</li>
<li>Shoot 1 in each target, from 5 yards, week hand only starting from low ready (safety already off).</li>
<li>The time to reload and move forward was not part of the scoring.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was up early and managed to jam my gun after the first shot. I cleared one round, tried again, cleared another, and the Range Safety Officer (RSO) pointed out the magazine was loose. I never got upset but I was puzzled. He stopped the clock and told me we were going to start over. That&#8217;s not normal match protocol, but clearly this wasn&#8217;t going to give me an unfair advantage as I wasn&#8217;t going to win anything&#8230; but it did allow me to clear my head and focus on the stage. It was kind and appreciated. These matches aren&#8217;t sanctioned or this wouldn&#8217;t have been an option. Once I started over I ended the stage with no downs: all the shots were in the down zero area. I&#8217;m slow. But clearly my accuracy is improving. I ended the stage with a smile.</p>
<p><strong>Skills</strong></p>
<p>I do need to understand why my gun is jamming and dropping the magazine at matches. It doesn&#8217;t happen to me at the range when I practice, just at matches. In the last class I took, I learn to check these things after loading: <strong>tug</strong> the magazine, <strong>press</strong> check (verify a round is loaded by easing the slide back just enough to see it) and verify visually and by touch the gun is in <strong>battery</strong> (the slide is fully forward).</p>
<p>I have been skipping the &#8220;tug&#8221;. Adding a safety to the gun made the press check more complicated and all my attention has gone to that step. Turns out, at a competition when you are using a barney mag (with a single round to top off) there really is no need for the press check. The RSO at my last match in Oxford told me that but I didn&#8217;t understand why. The RSO at this match put it in simple terms: if there was one round in the magazine and you remove the magazine, where else could that round possibly be? Without the press check I can put the safety back on as soon as I load and leave it there.</p>
<p>So going forward, at a match, I need to focus on the magazine and battery checks. Hopefully that will address the issue I&#8217;ve been having. If not, there is more to learn. One of the RSOs thought I might be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limp_wristing">limp-wristing</a> the gun but I don&#8217;t see how that could cause the magazine to come loose.</p>
<p><strong>The Rest of the Stages</strong></p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t take pictures of all the stages and I had no further malfunctions. For February, it was a beautiful sunny day. After getting very cold at the last Oxford match I brought several layers. I ended up wearing a t-shirt and a concealment vest. The sunshine was a real bonus.</p>
<p>My accuracy is definitely getting better. Here&#8217;s the number of downs for each stage:</p>
<p>Stage 1: 0 down, 2nd to last<br />
Stage 2: 0 down, 2nd to last<br />
Stage 3: 0 down, 2nd to last<br />
Stage 4: 1 down, 4th to last<br />
Stage 5: 10 down, 2nd to last (missed a shot)<br />
Stage 6:  1 down, 5th to last<br />
Over All: Dead last.</p>
<p>The guys on my squad were encouraging. &#8220;Work on your accuracy first, the speed will come&#8221;. The RSO reminded me to aim for the berm, not the ground, when pulling the trigger after unloading (thank you). We had stages with movement and one of the shooters took two of us aside to demonstrate the best way to move smoothly: walk heel-to-toe (which I knew) and at a slight crouch (which I wasn&#8217;t doing). Again, thank you. I used to compete in dancing and I know how to walk heel-to-toe (can you say waltz?) either forward or backwards, but the crouch makes all the difference.</p>
<p>Stages included these props and skills: We started one stage with our hand on the battery of a truck with the hood propped up. We shot bad guys using the truck as cover. One stage was set up like a bowling alley and we started by dropping a ball. Some stages required head shots. At least one stage required slicing the pie, another shooting in tactical sequence. One required kneeling behind cover. One required shooting all targets while seated at a picnic table. One required moving from a doorway, to a window, to another window.</p>
<p>Unlike Oxford, there is no place to put your gear except on the ground in the bays where stages are set up. I need to bring a ground barrier for wet days.</p>
<p>I had a few non-shooting conversations. Oddly enough, one was about climbing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_McKinley">Mount McKinley</a>. One guy in our squad was wearing a t-shirt from Alaska and that started up a conversation about the state and a comment from another shooter about wanting to climb the mountain. I&#8217;d made an attempt when I was younger so I actually had something to contribute. It was nice to be able to talk about something other than what I was doing wrong.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, just like all the matches I shoot, I was a happy camper. I&#8217;m starting to recognize faces, even if I&#8217;m lousy with names and I hope to shoot matches at Caswell Ranch on a regular basis.</p>

			<p>I shot my 2nd match in Oxford on February 3rd. Here&#8217;s a summary of the experience:</p>
<p>When we were doing squad introductions, one of the guys said &#8220;You&#8217;re the GirlGoesBang blogger.&#8221; And I was floored. Someone other than family and close friends reads this blog&#8230; go figure? But I&#8217;m smiling as I write this (thank you!).  Another guy remembered me as <a href="../../../../the-triple-crown-my-volunteer-experience/index.html">the girl who tied up Honey Bunny!</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I met the author of this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fall-Republic-Seasons-War-ebook/dp/B00AR3OO1G/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=1ZZGC3PM6CVQO&amp;coliid=I2QWWNRVQWSU4U">Fall of the Republic</a> by Jim Hicks. Jim was in my squad. I heard him talking with another guy on the squad about a survivalist fiction book. Since that is my favorite subject matter at the moment I asked about the book and it turns out he was discussing his book. I&#8217;ve added it to my reading list and will drop him a note once I&#8217;ve read it.</p>
<p>Now I have to admit something: I&#8217;m having trouble telling many of these guys apart. Many are trim, in khaki pants, vest and caps and have military type haircuts. I&#8217;m hoping I&#8217;ll start recognizing faces but twice I asked one fellow a question thinking he was someone else. It&#8217;s very embarrassing and I hope I&#8217;ll get better at recognizing the regulars.</p>
<div>I am really struggling with the 1911:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I nudge the safety up at times when I don&#8217;t wrap my short little thumb over the safety.</li>
<li>The magazines sometimes don&#8217;t seat right, and</li>
<li>at least 3 times the gun wasn&#8217;t in battery &#8212; because a round jammed &#8212; and I have no idea why.</li>
</ul>
<p>I really, really miss the simplicity of my XD.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>After the match, one of the guys in my squad suggested relaods with less recoil. Tunrs out they cost less than what I&#8217;ve been buying retail (well, they would if prices stabilized and he could get supplies again). And I can get a further discount for supplying my own brass. It appears all that brass I&#8217;ve been saving may do me some good even if I don&#8217;t reload myself.</div>
<p>After I was finished and headed home, I called Mom to check in with her. She went to her local range all by herself the day before. That&#8217;s a first for her! She&#8217;s in her 70&#8217;s so I have to say it: You are never too old to learn something new.</p>
<div><em><strong>Notes on the Stages:</strong></em></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>New for me, I started seated in a car and shot through the passenger window and driver&#8217;s window. There was no glass in the windows. I was advised to watch the steering wheel when moving the gun across the car.</li>
<li>I start another stage lying on the couch, in theory watching the super bowl. I shot two targets while laying on the couch and I found it very hard to aim. My body wanted to roll back into the cushions when I rocked forward toward the targets. I took a procedural penalty on this stage as I was supposed to reload before getting off the couch. In the excitement of the stage, I stood to reload. If this had been real I&#8217;d have made myself more of a target to the bad guys.</li>
<li>My last stage (the 3rd stage in the video below): I was very slow but I shot 6 targets and got no &#8220;downs&#8221; (all shots were in the targeted zones). That was a nice ending to my day!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Even better, here is video of the stages. The shooter who posted this video to You Tube, Ben, wasn&#8217;t in my squad. He&#8217;s a much better shooter than I am and he makes this look easy. I&#8217;m posting the video so you can get a first hand look at the stages:</div>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I missed the IDPA matches nearest where I live in November and December due to family holiday obligations. I am also getting used to the 1911 I bought and was finally able to shoot in mid-November (after getting the grips downsized). I&#8217;m not used to a gun with a thumb safety and I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m a big fan at this point. However, I bought the gun, I paid a twice what I&#8217;ve paid for any other gun and I want to spend the time to give it a fair assessment.</p>
<p>So after 7 trips to the range to practice things that are new with this gun like the grip and draw with a thumb safety, I decided to shoot an outdoor match at The Range in Oxford today. This was my first outdoor match and the first match I&#8217;ve decided to shoot and not arranged to meet a friend there. I did email Frank to ask about the calendar and confirm what time the match started. I told him I&#8217;d be there as I wanted to make a commitment to someone. I&#8217;ve found that knowing I&#8217;m accountable to my word is a strong motivator for me and I was very nervous about this due to the new gun, new range, and no friends for moral support.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_3323.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-326 alignright" title="IMG_3323" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_3323.jpg" alt="" width="301" height="117" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_3323.jpg 301w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_3323-300x116.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" /></a></p>
<p>This morning it was raining as I left my house but was clear as I arrived at The Range. The first lesson of the day is that registration starts at 11am but the match doesn&#8217;t start until 1pm. I&#8217;ll be targeting a 12:30 arrival in the future.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure what to wear as it was just over freezing when I left my house. Ideally I wanted to tuck in everything but my concealment garment. By 1pm it was warm enough to easily do that but I might consider a larger pair of jeans to be able to manage that with thicker layers on colder days. I used a fleece vest as a concealment garment today and that worked well.</p>
<p>I brought no food or water. I did eat a substantial breakfast and they sell bottled water at a bargain (50 cents), but I should be more self sufficient. Beef jerky, granola bars, or something portable would be a good idea.</p>
<p>My range bag is heavy. At an indoor match I&#8217;d park it in the room where we wait for an open stage and come back to it between stages. At an outdoor match you haul it around. The only thing I really needed was ammo and my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Butler-Creek-9mm--45-Universal-Unloader/dp/B001HBHNHE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357523302&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=uplula">UpLULA</a> (for me an absolute necessity). In the future, I think I&#8217;ll leave the range bag in the car and bring a smaller bag from stage to stage with just food, water and ammo.</p>
<p>I attended a safety briefing for &#8220;new shooters&#8221; and was reminded to put on the gun &amp; holster at the car then DO NOT take the gun out of the holster until I get up to the line to shoot. It stays in the holster until I put it back in the car at the end of the match.</p>
<p>They split us into 6 squads and started us in one of 6 bays. Our squad started in Bay 2. We proceeded to 3,4,5,6, and 1. It went fairly quickly. There were about 10 shooters per squad so about 60 folks competing.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it went for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>The thumb safety caused me all kinds of issues. I had not practiced loading a barney round then doing a chamber check. I loaded the first round. The RSO says, &#8220;put on your safety&#8221;. I pulled the empty mag out and put in the full mag. I went to do a chamber check and it turns out you can&#8217;t if the safety is on. I worked this all out but it flustered me enough I didn&#8217;t check that the mag was seated and&#8230;. of course&#8230;. it wasn&#8217;t.</li>
<li>I ran into multiple issues on the 2nd stage I shot. At one point I did a tactical reload and popped the partially full magazine in the waist band of my jeans. I must I pushed a bit harder than usual as the next thing I felt was the magazine snaking down my leg until it hit the ground. Another first!</li>
<li>I was more accurate than previous matches, at the cost of speed. But for now I&#8217;m happy with that trade-off.</li>
<li>I had a few conversations with other shooters and felt that the Range Safety Officers were supportive.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a good day!<br />

			<p>In the previous post I <a href="../../../../the-triple-crown-my-volunteer-experience/index.html">shared my experience as a volunteer</a>.  But one post is just not enough.</p>
<p>I wanted to comment on the stages for the first and second match of the Triple Crown. I&#8217;m guessing I&#8217;d want to comment on the 3rd match too if I&#8217;d been there the 2nd day. I was dumbfounded at the creativity involved and wondered if this was typical of IDPA matches. Evidently not&#8230; One of the shooters shot the match and in his<a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/#stream/feed%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.feedburner.com%2FWhenTheBalloonGoesUp"> write up</a> about the match he said:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Nearly every major match has 1 stage, feature, target,shooting position or something that is the signature of the match and shooters discuss whenever that match comes up. This match was a little different in that almost every stage would have been that signature at another match.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Toni Dandreamatteo and Frank Glover created a 2 day event that, without hyperbole, may never be done again, because this match was mentally and physically draining for every shooter, volunteer and the staff that put it on.&#8221; Posted by: <a title="Posts by Ron Larimer" href="http://www.balloongoesup.com/blog/author/ronlarimer/" rel="author">Ron Larimer</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Having never attended an outside match of any kind, I&#8217;ll take his word for it. The day stage that really intrigued me was the one that used the sissors lift. I love heights and had never thought about shooting down. I had the opportunity to go up on the lift once the shooting had stopped and see the angle into and behind the parked car below.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_172" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0854-edited21.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-172 " title="DSCN0854-edited2" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0854-edited21.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="250" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0854-edited21.jpg 400w, ../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0854-edited21-300x187.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Target below the Scissors Lift<br />[Triple Crown, Day 1]</p></div> I also helped Toni clean up the lift before the rental company arrived to pick it up. It was 2 inches deep in brass at one spot. Toni extended the platform to get all the brass that had worked it&#8217;s way under the middle and was quick with the broom. Can you imagine the thoughts of the next rental customer if it had been just passed along? And I wonder how many shooters realize that the match director has many jobs, including one like this.</p>
<p>I helped set up several stages for the night match. I&#8217;d stand and hold targets while Toni directed, &#8220;back&#8221;, &#8220;left&#8221;, &#8220;not that far left&#8221;, etc. Each target was held in place by a metal spike to ensure that each squad through the stage shot the targets in the exact same placement. Targets were arranged to create challenging configurations when navigating a stage. He explained that advanced shooters would opt for the tougher shots and newer shooters could spend more time to move into a position to make the shot more clear. He reviewed options for holding a flashlight with me. Most important, he made me feel welcome and encouraged me to continue to grow my skills. But I digress&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_174" style="width: 370px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0855-stripclub-edited.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-174  " title="DSCN0855-stripclub-edited" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0855-stripclub-edited.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="372" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0855-stripclub-edited.jpg 450w, ../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0855-stripclub-edited-290x300.jpg 290w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Welcome to the Strip Club!

<p>Then there was the strip club. I think this was a &#8220;family&#8221; oriented strip club as the dress on that dancer was fairly modest.</p>
<p>However, the actions of the patrons in the private booths was a bit more risque. The &#8220;staff&#8221; was tagged as non-threats and I have to think the bad guys were a bit preoccupied. See photo below&#8230;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toni told me the night match would include fire, water, and several flavors of light. I didn&#8217;t really understand what me meant till I attended the briefing.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the brief list of the night stages and what unique situation or challenge was included.<em> I didn&#8217;t take the videos listed below, I found them with a quick search of YouTube. </em></p>
<p>1) The Water Stage included shooting out a window through a rain storm. The never ending storm was created via a fountain that was rigged just above the outside of the window. I heard one story when I was entering scores about a shooter who extended his gun into the &#8220;storm&#8221; and couldn&#8217;t figure out why it was steaming. The things you just don&#8217;t think about, eh? This stage also required a flashlight.</p>
<p>2) The &#8220;Police&#8221; Stage included a car with flashing orange and blue lights (think strobe).</p>
<p>3) The Strip Club used regular lighting and, in the process, worked against eyes that had become adjusted to the dark.</p>
<p>4) The &#8220;HeadLights&#8221; stage was triggered by a motion sensor and included shooting 3 steel plates across the bumper of a deliver truck (to stop the truck) and shooting a light bulb through a small hole in a steel plate that emulated a motorcycle headlight. [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwalWZ_MvyA">Video here</a>].</p>
<p>5) The Deck stage was originally designed to be shot with an oil lantern as the only light. Guess what? The muzzle flash kept blowing out the lantern. This required a change in the stage requirements to switch to flashlights and the first group re-shot the stage after the change. I thought: better to figure this out in a match rather than in your own back yard with someone shooting back at you.</p>
<p>6) The Camp Fire stage was shot with light from the (electric) campfire only. Targets were very low to the ground to simulate a dog pack zeroing in on your campsite.</p>
<p>7) The Glock Convenience Store stage was shot using a large Mag Light provided at the stage. The entrance to the store was obscured by dangling firehose and would have been a challenge to shoot in daylight.</p>

Imagine sitting in the driver&#8217;s seat of a wrecked car with the engine on fire and having to defend yourself against a half a dozen freaks with guns. This stage simulated that experience. A flashlight was needed to pinpoint the furthest targets. [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE-H1wnTJsM">Video here</a>].</p>
<p>Shooting started at 6:30pm and the last set of scores came in around midnight. It was bitter cold and a big contrast to the 70 degree afternoon. These two matches made for a very long, very interesting day.</p>
<p>Attending as a volunteer still raised my awareness about shooting a match like one of these and prompted some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you layer to stay warm enough at night but not have your clothing get in the way of your holster and concealment garment?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s the minimum amount of gear you need in your range bag as you have to haul it from stage to stage?</li>
<li>How to you insure you don&#8217;t lose gear in the dark?</li>
</ul>
<div>If this sounds like something you want the opportunity to shoot, there is another Day / Night / Day match next month: December 8 &#8211; 9 2012. Details are on the home page for <a href="http://www.the-range.com/">The Range</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Thanks to everyone who made me feel welcome. I have much to learn but this experience has made me eager to put the time in to improve my skills. Attend one match at The Range and you will never be a stranger again.</div>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I read about the IDPA Triple Crown in several blog posts. <a href="http://www.balloongoesup.com/blog/2012/11/the-idpa-triple-crown/">This one</a> says it best. I wanted to shoot but I&#8217;m making trade-offs financially after purchasing my first 1911 and all the accessories to set it up for competition. I&#8217;d been to <a href="http://www.gloryroad.net/~idpa/">The Range</a> only once before to <a href="../../../../shooting-my-idpa-classifier/index.html">shoot my IDPA Classifier</a> but I had briefly discussed working matches with Frank when I was there.</p>
<p>Even though I wasn&#8217;t willing to spend the money to complete, I wanted to see how outdoor stages differed from what I&#8217;d been shooting on an indoor range and I wanted to widen my network of shooting friends. So I called and volunteered to work the day and night match on Saturday. Frank said he&#8217;d put me to work and to come on up.</p>
<p>It seemed like a good idea at the time but when I pulled into the parking area at 9:30am Saturday morning I saw groups of people chatting and I thought, &#8220;What was I thinking? I don&#8217;t know a single soul here but Frank and he&#8217;s going to be very, very busy&#8221;. I took a deep breath and parked the car. I checked in at the only functioning building and told a stranger that I was here to help out. Again, I had second thoughts about this impulsive idea.</p>
<div id="attachment_149" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0852-crop-small.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-149 " title="DSCN0852-crop-small" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0852-crop-small-300x234.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="234" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0852-crop-small-300x234.jpg 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0852-crop-small-383x300.jpg 383w, ../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0852-crop-small.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Focusing on the job: entering scores with the &#8220;Den Mother&#8221; who made me feel welcome.</p></div>
<p>Then I found something I could do that really needed to be done: I networked the two laptops used for the match scoring program. I do tech support for a living and am happy to leave the job behind when I head to the range, but in this case it won me a new friend and the &#8220;Den Mother Stamp of Approval&#8221;. I was immediately recruited to enter scores and that nagging feeling that this was not my brightest idea disappeared as soon as her words were out.</p>
<p>We had some time to wait before the first scores would come in, so Frank offered to let me ride along while he took care of last minute setup issues. He showed me how to drive the Gator (think: topless golf cart) and he told me a bit about several of the stages as we fine tuned them. Then he got a call:  &#8220;Honey Bunny&#8217;s pants are falling off.&#8221; Say what???</p>
<p>Turns out  the match director&#8217;s nickname is &#8220;<a href="http://www.rangelog.com/tabid/661/Default.aspx?MemberUserId=2036">Honey Bunny</a>&#8221; and they set up a special stage in honor of (or was it to bust on&#8230;) him. Turns out it&#8217;s his nickname but also what he calls everyone he meets. Of course I didn&#8217;t know this yet&#8230; Here&#8217;s the setup for the stage: <em>You are in a convenience store after an IDPA Sanctioned Match when you hear &#8220;Hey Honey Bunny!!!&#8221;. You turn around and Honey Bunny gives you a hug. Just at that moment, bad guys enter the store shooting</em>. Start Position: <em>You with Honey Bunny hugging you with his revolver holstered on his belt. You draw the revolver to shoot the bad guys.</em> In this case, the stage Honey Bunny is a 6 foot stuffed rabbit. And his pants kept falling off due to the weight of the gun.</p>
<div id="attachment_150" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0846-crop-small.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-150" title="DSCN0846-crop-small" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0846-crop-small-300x285.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="285" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0846-crop-small-300x285.jpg 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0846-crop-small-315x300.jpg 315w, ../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0846-crop-small.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sadie and Honey Bunny, post-bondage</p></div>
<p>I think someone mentioned suspenders. I asked Frank if he had some rope and told him I could fix this for him. And I did! Frank and I pulled up to the stage and got out of the Gator. There were 8-10 shooters looking at us and Frank looks at me and says to go ahead and fix the rabbit. No pressure here, eh? Remember I don&#8217;t know any of these people, yet, and I&#8217;d like to make some new friends.</p>
<p>I used a bowline on a front belt loop, took the rope behind the rabbit&#8217;s head and tied off to the front belt loop on the other side of his zipper. One of the guys suggested I tie to the back belt loops too. I was already on it. We had plenty of rope so I secured the 2nd front belt loop, went over the shoulder and diagonal across the rabbit&#8217;s back to ensure the rope wouldn&#8217;t slip off his shoulder. I passed the rope in front of the rabbit&#8217;s neck to get opposing tension for the last belt loop in the back and muttered under my breath, &#8220;You&#8217;d never do this with a person&#8221; and one of the shooters asked me if I taught bondage classes. That got a good laugh! One shooter gave me a fist pump and that really meant a lot to me. And now Frank has a new story to tell about the bondage bunny.</p>
<div id="attachment_152" style="width: 265px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0872-edited-small.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-152 " title="DSCN0872-edited-small" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0872-edited-small-255x300.jpg" alt="" width="255" height="300" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0872-edited-small-255x300.jpg 255w, ../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCN0872-edited-small.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sadie with the original Honey Bunny: my boss for the afternoon.</p></div>
<p>I managed to sneak in a few photos of the most intriguing day stage (think: high!) but spent most of the match entering scores. Once the day match was complete, I offered to help do the final setup for the night match and Toni put me to work. That&#8217;s when I heard the full disclosure about the Honey Bunny moniker.</p>
<p>Toni was very patient with my numerous questions while I helped set up targets and props for the night stages. He chatted with me about flashlights, the best way to shoot the stages we set up and how these matches were similar to or different from other matches. I helped clean up used targets from previous matches and tried my best to be useful.</p>
<p>Frank fed the staff and range safety officers Brunswick stew made by a local church that was excellent. The night match started around 6:30pm. The night stages vastly exceeded what I thought was possible and I&#8217;ll cover that in a future post. The last scores came in around midnight and I headed home by 12:15am. Very tired but very happy.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t meet many shooters, but I did meet people that helped me to get a better understanding of how competitions work and more important, made me feel welcome. I definitely see more volunteering in my future.</p>

[Photo:coleimage.com]</p></div>October 23, 2012: On the way up to Oxford I called a friend and told him I was headed up to shoot my Classifier. He asked me what that meant and I said, “Call me tomorrow and I’ll let you know”.</p>
<p>Part of this journey is learning to deal with the unexpected because bad guys aren’t going to give you a heads up and allow you to plan for their malicious or deadly behavior. I did know a Classifier is a specific course of fire. You can hunt down the details and train specifically for that course of fire, but I think that also defeats the purpose. If you place higher than your true skill level by training specifically for the Classifier, the folks you complete against are going to give you a beating until you can shoot that well on unknown stages.</p>
<p>I did know this: bring the gear you use to compete (gun, holster, two magazine pouches, 4 magazines), 2 boxes (50 rounds each) of ammo, and the gear you use every time you shoot: eye and ear protection, a high necked shirt and stable shoes that cover your feet.</p>
<p>I called Frank in advance and asked if a friend could watch. She lives 10 minutes from the range and is a <a href="http://coleimage.com/">photographer</a>. He said she was welcome and photos were fine. I asked if she could rent eye and ears protection as I didn’t have spares. He said he had some he could loan her. No charge. How could I possibly be nervous shooting with this man?</p>
<p>My friend and I hooked up in the parking area and hunted Frank down in the only functional building on the property. I found Frank friendly, welcoming, and a clear communicator.</p>
<p><strong>The Classifier</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Here are the highlights of the classifier. If you want specifics, I’m sure you can hunt that down via Google.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>90 rounds “limited”. For each course of fire, shoot the number of rounds requested only. No makeup shots.</li>
<li>There were 3 targets in various heights about 2 or 3 yards apart. All courses of fire were into these targets on a single range.</li>
<li>No cover garment is required, so I ditched my concealment vest.</li>
<li>He asked me what my mag capacity was and then asked me to load 15 rounds in all 4 magazines. It speeds up the process as less time is required to reload. Normal IDPA maximum capacity is 10 rounds.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Shooting scenarios included</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>“2 shots to the body” for almost all scenarios</li>
<li>Limited set of head shots</li>
<li>Strong hand only</li>
<li>Weak hand only</li>
<li>From as far as 20 yards</li>
<li>Shooting while moving forward</li>
<li>Shooting while moving backward</li>
<li>From behind tall cover (both left and right sides)</li>
<li>Kneeling behind low cover</li>
<li>Slide lock reloads</li>
<li>Tactical reloads with retention</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>The cost: $2 to cover targets. As Frank put it, “I’ll be collecting $15 every time you show up to compete” and he’s happy with that.</li>
<li>The time: about an hour.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><strong>Shooting Outside</strong></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">The weather was great, even though this was late October. The day was clear and in the high 70s. I wore a t-shirt and was comfortable. I do need to think about layers for cold days and how that is going to work with concealment, but that was not an issue today.</span></p>
<p>This was the first time I’ve shot outside. It was a bright sunny day and I had not thought of getting impact resistant lenses with a sunglass tint. Do they even make something like that? I asked Frank what he recommended and he shared something like this, “The more light you let in, the better your ability to aim”. He doesn’t use sunglasses, he uses his hat. I’d clipped a hat to my range bag a few months back though I’ve never really used it. Today was the day. That worked well.</p>
<p>Every time I’ve shot “on the move” in classes, I had a nice smooth floor with nothing more than ejected brass under my feet. At the Classifier I was walking on gravel and it shifted underfoot. It’s not stable and I do remember thinking, “didn’t think about the ground surface” followed by “I need to come up here to shoot more often.”</p>
<p>A final observation: it’s really fun to see the dirt go “poof” as you bang away at the targets!</p>
<p><strong>After the Shooting Stopped</strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_65" style="width: 169px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/InstructionsFromFrank3343-small.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-65 " title="InstructionsFromFrank(3343)-small" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/InstructionsFromFrank3343-small-159x300.jpg" alt="" width="159" height="300" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/InstructionsFromFrank3343-small-159x300.jpg 159w, ../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/InstructionsFromFrank3343-small.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 159px) 100vw, 159px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One on one: instructions from Frank [Photo: coleimage.com]</p></div>I ranked as a Novice. No big surprise. I obviously slapped the trigger a bunch because many of my shots were low. I slacked off my dry fire practice after the last class I took and I paid for that. I’m motivated to get back to that ASAP.</p>
<p>I joined the IDPA via their website last weekend. They sent me a receipt but no membership number. Frank told me that might take 2 weeks and it would come via US Mail. Once I had the number, drop him email and “he’d take it from there” as far as getting my ranking to them.</p>
<p><strong>The Range</strong></p>
<p>Frank asked if we’d like a tour of the shoot house and my friend was included so we checked it out and she grabbed some photos. The bathroom was especially scary!</p>
<p>I asked what the cost was to shoot up here for practice and Frank said membership was $100 a year. That’s very reasonable, just wish it wasn’t a 2 hour round trip to get there. Of course this may just be the motivation I need to visit my friend more often.</p>
<p>I stuck around to chat with Frank and another fellow that had watched me shoot. Both talked to me about the merits of reloading – which many people have done. But Frank followed up with an offer to walk me through the process. I’d be stupid not to take him up on that.</p>
<p><strong>The Belly Laugh</strong></p>
<p>I got about a mile down the road before it started… a giggle that grew and expanded into a serious belly laugh. It ripples out of me and I love the giddy feeling. Almost every time I shoot this happens. I don’t know if it’s the after effect of adrenaline or where it comes from. But it’s the reason I keep working at this: feeling joy and passion make life so much better.</p>

			<div>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">I’ve shot 3 IDPA matches and each time I’ve been in the “unclassified” group. At the last competition I was dead last. Though I completed all 6 stages and there were folks who left early. So to keep my head in the game I take a bit of pride that<br />
</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">&#8211; I showed up and I’m working on my skills.<br />
</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">&#8211; I’m not a quitter. I finished the course of fire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">In the training class I recently attended, I learned that you have to shoot a “classifier” to be put in a class of shooters. In theory those are the people you are competing against. I tend to look at all the scores to see what’s possible but it might be nice to compete against others that are in a comparable place. So last week I decided to figure out how to get classified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The only place to shoot a classifier is about an hour away at a range I’ve never been to in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford,_North_Carolina">Oxford, NC</a>. It’s called “The Range” and it turns out they hosted Nationals this year. Never saw that coming… My sister lives in Oxford so I’m familiar with the town. It&#8217;s a small town (less than 10,000 people at the last census) with a lot of history, but it&#8217;s not the place I would picture a national event. That was before I started shooting, eh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">I called Frank, the owner and asked about shooting a classifier. Turns out business is good for Frank and he doesn’t run classifiers on the weekend at this time. He told me to come up during the week. I picked a day then realized that this is an outdoor range. I called back and asked him if it mattered if it was raining. Frank said “If you want to shoot in the rain, I’ll run the timer.” Nice guy. I’m not that hard core.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Today is clear and I’ll be headed to Oxford about 3pm. A new range, new people to meet, and as a bonus, dinner with my sister after the Classifier. </span></p>

			<p>I bought a Smith  &amp; Wesson Pro Tactical 1911 in 9mm two weeks ago and I haven&#8217;t shot it yet. I bought the 1911 because the instructor of one of the classes I took recently insisted that I needed a gun that could be adapted to small hands. With a single stack and modular grips, the 1911 is the best candidate. I&#8217;m still waiting on the slim grips I ordered to come in. Until they do, the gun will remain a virgin.</p>
<p>I ordered all the accessories I&#8217;ll need to compete in IPDA with the new gun: A Kydex holster dropped and offset, two Kydex mag holsters also dropped and offset, and 3 extra Wilson Combat magazines. Two came with the gun, so this gives me a total of five magazines: 3 for competition, 1 for a <a title="Barney mag" href="http://www.thehighroad.org/archive/index.php/t-7616.html">Barney mag</a>, and one extra because, well, I was told it&#8217;s always good to have a spare.</p>
<p>The new news today: you need to break in the magazines. I ordered them from the instructor that advised the 1911 purchase. When I picked them up today, I found out that the new Wilson Combat mags are too tight initially and may cause the gun to malfunction. The way to address that issue is to load them to full capacity and let them sit like that for at least 3 weeks. As of tonight they are loaded and &#8220;breaking in&#8221;.</p>
<p>Another tip I got was to number the magazines. If the gun starts to malfunction this will allow you to check to see if it&#8217;s always the same mag. If so, it might be the mag, not the gun with issues. One of my instructors uses marker pens, another uses fingernail polish. I have had a bad experience with fingernail polish and guns, and I didn&#8217;t own a marker pen, so I opted to use my label maker. I labeled the back spine as I don&#8217;t touch that surface when I load. I&#8217;ll report back if that turns out to be a bad decision.</p>

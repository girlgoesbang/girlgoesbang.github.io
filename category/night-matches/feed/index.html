				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The guys who host the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Wake-County-Action-Pistol-Match/1479450158972916">Wake County Action Pistol Matches</a> hosted a no light / low light match last night. It was my first night match. I wasn&#8217;t the only night match &#8220;virgin&#8221;. Only after I arrived did I stop to think about how to reload a gun with a flashlight one hand. Turns out you do it pretty much they same way you do it without the light &#8211; but probably slower.</p>
<p>I entered the handheld light division. I&#8217;d picked up an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Olight-T20-R5-Lumen-Flashlight/dp/B0051F7SPE/ref=sr_1_1">Olight T20</a> at the local gun show last year for every day carry. It seemed to me it would be bright enough and it worked fine for the match. I have small hands and I picked this due to it&#8217;s very small size. It puts out 270 lumens. This was plenty bright to shoot the match.</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_20150311_180722.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1077" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_20150311_180722-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_20150311_180722" width="225" height="300" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_20150311_180722-225x300.jpg 225w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_20150311_180722-768x1024.jpg 768w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_20150311_180722.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>We didn&#8217;t need to draw from a holster, but I picked up a $9 belt holster at Lowe&#8217;s last week just to have a place to stash the light when I wasn&#8217;t shooting. You get what you pay for: it was so tight that I could barely squeeze in the (very thin) light. I shoved a larger light in and let it sit for a week &#8211; that loosened up the elastic enough to make it functional for the match. I see the value of a holster designed for the light.I just don&#8217;t know where to get one for this light.</p>
<p>I did hunt down a few youtube videos to check out technique. I&#8217;d taken a class a few years back where we tried this but I honestly didn&#8217;t remember much. These were helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbNBlyyiydM">Talon Training: Flashlight Shooting Techniques</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb1QMqk_wmU">RugerFirearms: Tactical Tips Part-12: Flash Light Technique</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59YyfJrW-Ps">Polenar Tactical: Flashlight Shooting Techniques</a> (very short overview)</li>
</ul>
<p>The RSOs were great. Everyone was encouraged to take their time and above all be safe. We shot 4 stages and had some special treats: one stage incorporated a flashing blue light, one had a swinger, and one had a target with a flashlight pointed at the shooter.</p>
<p>Lessons I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>I shoot well with one hand. So the FBI Technique worked well for me. However, when I keep the light close to me, I also tended to hold the gun in close. I need to remember to extend my shooting arm.</li>
<li>I limp wrist when I use the Harries Hold. I lost count of the malfunctions I had on Stage 4. The entire stage was shot from a sitting position and I tried using this hold. I really want to give that another try and focus on holding the gun rather than creating opposing tension against each hand. But this is why I shot the match: to learn where I need to work next.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is the video that Ben posted after the match you give you an idea what the shooter saw. I really look forward to the next opportunity to try this again.</p>

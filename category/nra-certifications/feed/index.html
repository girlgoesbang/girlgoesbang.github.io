<p>I took a break from shooting due to the cost of the ammo I was burning through. I also realized I was shooting for fun, but not really improving my skills. I decided to take my shooting in a different direction in the short term.</p>
<p>My mom asked me to take her shooting, a woman I used to work for asked me to take her shooting, and a volunteer opportunity I signed up for resulted in me coaching new women shooters. All that seemed to point in one direction: learn to teach.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been up to:</p>
<ul>
<li>I volunteered for a <a href="http://women.nra.org/womens-instructional-shooting-clinics.aspx">Women On Target<sup>®</sup></a> (WOT) event October 20, 2013 at the <a href="http://www.dcwc.info/about.php">Durham County Wildlife Club</a>. The great ladies that run the event encouraged me to get my pistol instructor certification so&#8230;</li>
<li>I passed an NRA certified Pistol Instructor class on November 10th, 2013.</li>
<li>I volunteered to teach a section of a NRA 1st Steps Pistol (Ladies Only) class sponsored by the <a href="http://www.wakegov.com/sheriff/services/firingrange/Pages/default.aspx">Wake County Range</a> on December 8, 2013</li>
<li>I passed an NRA Range Safety Officer course on Sunday February 2, 2014.</li>
<li>I volunteered for a <a href="http://women.nra.org/womens-instructional-shooting-clinics.aspx">Women On Target®</a> (WOT) event March 30, 2014 at the <a href="http://www.sirwaltergunclub.com/">Sir Walter Gun Club</a>. I worked the &#8220;pistol plinking&#8221; event where we taught women to shoot 9mm pistols and shoot steel targets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do I feel I&#8217;m ready to go out and start a business teaching people to shoot? Heck no! But I do want to find volunteer opportunities to work with more seasoned instructors and build my skills.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really a thrill to see a group of ladies walk into a class room with some level of trepidation and/or anticipation at the beginning of a class then see them leave with a sense of real accomplishment ( and a target with bullet holes in it!) at the end of the day.</p>

<p>Awhile back my dad<a href="http://girlgoesbang.com/35-what/"> offered me 3 rifles</a> he&#8217;d had sitting in  gun case for years because I&#8217;m the only one in the family that shoots. I sold the 35 Remington and had the Winchester 74 restored. The elevator was lost in the process so the friend who did such a great job on restoring the rifle met me at the range June 8th to install the elevator and site in the gun.</p>
<p>Elevator? He had to explain to me what an elevator was so I&#8217;ll share that with you: it is a small metal part that wedges under the sight to raise or lower it. For more details, check out this <a href="http://hunting.about.com/od/guns/ig/Home-Gun-Refinishing/Win_94_Refinish_13.htm">article</a>.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t fired from bench rest position since my &#8220;First Steps Pistol&#8221; class. We used my range bag as the &#8220;rest&#8221;. It&#8217;s a $15 tool bag from Walmart and worked quite well. My mentor for the day asked me to rest the &#8220;forearm&#8221; (ie: the wooden part) of the barrel on the rest, not the metal part of the barrel. I tucked the buttstock into my shoulder and brought the gun up to my face. At that point you try to get a good cheek weld by holding it is snuggly. Note that you don&#8217;t bring your face down to the stock &#8211; bring the gun up to your face.</p>
<p>We had about 18 yards to work with and the gun was shooting a bit high. It&#8217;s supposed to be sighted in at 25 yards so this was to be expected. The gun will shoot slightly higher at shorter distances.</p>
<p>Everything was going well until I tried to shoot the gun. At that point it went &#8220;tap&#8221; instead of &#8220;bang&#8221;. It appears we were getting an inconsistent firing pin strike.</p>
<p>The problem may be the firing pin but more likely is with the firing pin spring. So it appears this gun will require an additional investment of cash&#8230; and I&#8217;m kind of bummed about that. My primary focus is on pistols, but I have a large stash of .22lr and this is a beautiful gun. I really need to decide if it&#8217;s worth investing in a rifle I really don&#8217;t shoot &#8212; at least not at this time.</p>

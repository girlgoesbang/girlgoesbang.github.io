				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t read many other gun blogs because I&#8217;m trying to get out and shoot, not sit in front of a computer nearly as much as I have. But there are a few I read. And every once in awhile I read an article that leaves me thinking &#8220;I would never have thought about that&#8221;. Recently there were two defense related articles that made me think about all the things I don&#8217;t know about defensive shooting. Maybe reading blogs can be more helpful than I realized.</p>
<p>The simple one that really made me go &#8220;duh&#8221; was from Kathy Jackson at the <strong><em>Cornered Cat</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.corneredcat.com/squib/">Squib</a>. The point of the article is that your behavior should be very different on a practice range than it should be in a defensive situation, if you actually notice the issue during the adrenaline dump of a defensive situation.</p>
<div id="attachment_644" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSCN1007sm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-644" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSCN1007sm.jpg" alt="From a recent match at The Range in Oxford: the entire stage was shot from the back seat of this car" width="500" height="407" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSCN1007sm.jpg 500w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSCN1007sm-300x244.jpg 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSCN1007sm-368x300.jpg 368w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">From a recent match at The Range in Oxford: the entire stage was shot from the back seat of this car</p></div>
<p>The more complicated post that made me realize that I have put much too little thought into defensive scenarios was by Ron Larimer at <strong>When the Balloon Goes Up!. </strong>The post is &#8220;<span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.balloongoesup.com/blog/developing-mental-notecards/">Developing mental notecards</a>&#8221; and lays out a flowchart scenario of options if you were in a bad situation in your car. My background is programming and I like the flowchart approach &#8211; but more than that it made me consider situations that never crossed my mind: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Not blocked in? If not, drive away. Always remember that your 1st choice is to leave.</li>
<li>Am I alone? My default situation is to be driving alone, but that isn&#8217;t always the case and I shouldn&#8217;t let that be a &#8220;how the heck to I deal with a passenger&#8221; situation. &#8220;Get down and cover your ears!&#8221; gives them a chance to limit damage if I shoot.</li>
<li>Think about the seat belt and how that may impede you.</li>
<li>How does the location of the threat affect use of the car for cover?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s where shooting matches has helped:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever tried to draw in a car? I have at the local IDPA match. I&#8217;m so glad to have had that experience. That is very valuable practice. Below is the set of targets shot from the backseat of the car shown above:</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first learned to shoot, at the NRA First Steps Pistol class, they explained &#8220;<a href="http://www.balloongoesup.com/blog/what-is-your-dominant-eye/">eye dominance</a>&#8220;. I closed one eye to aim and was most accurate that way, so I continued shooting that way.</p>
<p>When I took defensive shooting classes, I heard over and over: keep both eyes open. You lose peripheral vision and that might include a bad guy who&#8217;s trying to shoot you. I have periodically tried to practice with both eyes open and see double, get frustrated, and go back to closing one eye.</p>
<div id="attachment_599" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Dean-Sadie-sm.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-599   " alt="http://www.balloongoesup.com/blog/what-is-your-dominant-eye/" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Dean-Sadie-sm.jpg" width="350" height="496" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Dean-Sadie-sm.jpg 500w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Dean-Sadie-sm-211x300.jpg 211w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dean coaching Sadie. Dean provides lots of personal coaching in his classes.</p></div>
<p>I took a class up at Caswell Ranch from Dean Brevit on April 6th, 2013. The most valuable thing I took away from Dean&#8217;s class was a new way to look at the target.</p>
<p>For defensive shooting, look at the target. Bring the gun up and when it gets in the way of the target, pull the trigger.</p>
<p>That is a huge over simplification, but it was the first explanation that really made sense to me.</p>
<p>The hitch: breaking the habit I&#8217;ve already established of closing one eye and lining up the sites.</p>
<p>Why does it matter? In a situation where another person is pointing a gun at you and is moving, it&#8217;s most likely that you will focus on the target. It is instinctive to focus on the threat. It&#8217;s also faster to shoot that way. The challenge is to maintain accuracy. And when the target is 6&#8243; in diameter, for IDPA or to hit a bad guy&#8217;s chest, it is possible to be accurate enough. Dean made a believer out of me.</p>
<p>Making the change is a slow process. I keep getting cross-eyed when I try to change my focus to the target. All my practice time has been devoted to this one skill the last few weeks.</p>
<p>However I have much more work to do. At the IDPA match I shot last Saturday night, I immediately went back to closing one eye. I knew I was doing it, was very accurate for me, and didn&#8217;t want to shoot even slower&#8230; possibly a bad trade off, but one I made.</p>
<p>Finally, in a &#8220;deja vu&#8221; moment this past week, another blog I follow posted an article about focusing on the target, so I&#8217;ll share that as well: <a href="http://www.balloongoesup.com/blog/target-focus/">Can target focus be good?</a> from Ron Larimer at When the Balloon Goes Up!</p>

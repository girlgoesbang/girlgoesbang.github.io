<p>This is a follow up to <a href="../xds-trigger-job-part1/">Part 1</a>. If you don&#8217;t want to read the entire blog post, the final verdict: new trigger weight after replacing the springs and the sear: between 4 3/4 and 5 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong><br />
I finally received the Spring &amp; Sear kit from Powder River Precision. It comes in a more costly but more professional looking package compared to the original spring kit. More to throw away after you unpackage the parts.</p>
<p>To install the sear, you have to take everything apart again that you disassembled to replace the springs. It&#8217;s non-trivial and frustrating to get everything lined up exactly right.  I find this review from the Powder River website to be dead on:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221; The video is pretty good, but in several places the demonstrator is holding the gun out of the camera range. Also the focus goes in and out. It&#8217;s obvious that he has done this a number of times, he goes really fast. There are a couple of parts that could use more clarity. A few of the springs are hard to figure out just because the kit is not marked for what spring goes where. <strong>Most importantly, when reinstalling the grip safety, there is a little lever that needs to be put in the exact right spot and the video doesn&#8217;t really show where.</strong> I put my gun back together with the lever off somehow and had to force the gun apart because the trigger would not trip. I then moved the lever around until it felt free, he tells you how to check it by having the grip safety locked by moving the trigger bar. Great trigger now, 4 hours later.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
</blockquote>
<p>So be sure to have an open block of time before attempting this. Here&#8217;s a comparison of the old and new sear:</p>
<div id="attachment_1113" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150328_095216-cropold-top-and-new-btm-XDS-sear.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1113" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150328_095216-cropold-top-and-new-btm-XDS-sear-300x255.jpg" alt="Old and New Sear (with spring)" width="300" height="255" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150328_095216-cropold-top-and-new-btm-XDS-sear-300x255.jpg 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150328_095216-cropold-top-and-new-btm-XDS-sear.jpg 305w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Old and New Sear (with spring)</p></div>
<p>We re-tested the &#8220;before&#8221; weight with a calibration set of NRA certified Weights (always the most accurate way to measure). Previously we used a trigger pull gauge<br />
but that is less accurate. We did take 3 measurements and averaged them to be as accurate as possible, but it appears that measurement was high, I had it listed at 6.5 pounds. When we measured again with the more accurate weight set, it tested at 5 3/4 pounds with the original sear.</p>
<div id="attachment_1114" style="width: 228px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150328_095710-cropNRA-Certified-Weights.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1114" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150328_095710-cropNRA-Certified-Weights-218x300.jpg" alt="NRA Certified Weights" width="218" height="300" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150328_095710-cropNRA-Certified-Weights-218x300.jpg 218w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150328_095710-cropNRA-Certified-Weights.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 218px) 100vw, 218px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">NRA Certified Weights</p></div>
<p>You basically stack up weights until you can no longer pick up the stack with your trigger. Here&#8217;s the final test for my updated gun. Yes, I&#8217;m impressed by the simplest things:<br />
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFQjoCGckT4" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a summary of the different trigger weights</p>
<ul>
<li>Trigger weight before the spring kit: 8 lbs</li>
<li>Trigger weight after the spring kit: 5.75 lbs</li>
<li>Trigger weight after the sear replacement: 4.75 &#8211; 5 lbs</li>
<li>Trigger weigh of my S&amp;W 1911: 3.25 lbs</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1059" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_20141228_081608-sm-178x300.jpg" alt="IMG_20141228_081608-sm" width="178" height="300" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_20141228_081608-sm-178x300.jpg 178w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_20141228_081608-sm.jpg 208w" sizes="(max-width: 178px) 100vw, 178px" /><br />
My gun smith, <a href="http://www.ogr-inc.com/">Kapp Ogburn</a>,  ordered the <a href="http://shop.powderriverprecision.net/product.sc?productId=87">Powder River trigger kit </a>for me after I decided <a href="../accuracy-1911-vs-xds-in-9mm/">I was willing to invest more into my XDS</a> (9mm). At the time he ordered, the only parts available were the springs. They had no sears in stock.</p>
<p>He installed the spring kit back on February 7th. I brought him the gun, watched the entire procedure, then took the gun over to <a href="http://www.pdhsc.com/">PDHSC </a>later in the day just to verify everything was working. It shot fine.  We watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8yBiTYAyJ8">&#8220;how to&#8221; video</a> and referred to photos he had taken when he&#8217;d done this in the past. The video is  just over 15 minutes. It took my gunsmith longer to swap out all the springs because he was patient enough to let me ask questions throughout the process.  There is no way I&#8217;d have done this. I did remember to ask that he test the trigger pull both before and after.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trigger weight before the spring kit: 8 lbs</li>
<li>Trigger weight after the spring kit: 6.5 lbs</li>
<li>Trigger weigh of my S&amp;W 1911: 3.25 lbs</li>
</ul>
<p>They now have the sear available, although oddly,<a href="http://shop.powderriverprecision.net/product.sc?productId=100&amp;categoryId=-1"> they only sell it with the spring kit</a>. I wrote Powder River and mentioned I&#8217;d already bought the spring kit. I asked if it was possible to just buy the sear. The response: &#8220;<em>We do not offer the sear as a stand-alone product at this time, but the price you pay is the cost of the sear, and our cost for the springs</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>My gunsmith thinks replacing the sear will take off another pound, possibly getting it down to 5 lbs. I asked him to order the sear, so as soon as I get that and get it installed, I&#8217;ll post another update (part 2).</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_20150224_194855-crop.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1060" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_20150224_194855-crop-300x207.jpg" alt="IMG_20150224_194855-crop" width="300" height="207" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_20150224_194855-crop-300x207.jpg 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_20150224_194855-crop.jpg 329w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>I did shoot the XDS in the Wake County Action Pistol Match on February 25th. I bought a red holster and mag pouches for matches and this was the first time I used them.</p>
<p>Snow was predicted and it started as we finished up the match. Attendance was low due to the weather but I was glad I went. It was warmer than the January match. I had no malfunctions with the XDS and I never got cold. It was a good night. A few lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grip the gun very high up on the grip to avoid a NASTY pinch (and bruise) on my palm when I reload. The bottom of the magazine seems to hit just about the bottom of my palm and it seriously hurts if I slam in the magazine and pinch flesh.</li>
<li>If you have to turn before you shoot., turn in the direction of the gun</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t walk into a doorway to shoot &#8211; because it&#8217;s going to take time to back out and move to the next target.</li>
<li>I was overdressed. I didn&#8217;t need a down vest. We started off at 40 degrees and were still slightly above freezing when the match ended &#8211;  even though we had snow dusting the cars when we headed home.</li>
</ul>

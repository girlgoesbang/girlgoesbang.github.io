		<description><![CDATA[Dena,
It would depend on where you live and who issued the permit. In Wake County, NC the permits are for 5 years. For now I have stepped back from shooting due to several events in my life. If you are looking for female instructors in my area, I&#039;d recommend attending the Ladies Handgun League at the Wake County Range. Several of the organizers are excellent instructors. Or check in at Triangle Shooting Academy near Brier Creek. I believe they have female instructors on staff. 

Thanks for stopping by!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi!  Thanks for this post- I’m not computer friendly &#038; get exhausted trying to find info on the dark web- and as you mentioned, everything you read isn’t always true.
So- how long does my CCW/Permit last?  I had thought it was 3 years, but you mentioned 5.
Just curious- do you give one on one instruction?  I know how to shoot- have been since I was 8.   I could use extra time with maintenance (and of course practice.)
Thanks so much!

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for reading. I&#039;m sorry for your loss. Oddly, my insurance company didn&#039;t ask for receipts except for the computer. They did ask for serial numbers on the firearms. Based on a comment made by the Detective, if you have any gun bumper stickers on your vehicle you might consider removing them. They will make your vehicle a target for thieves. Frustrating. But that&#039;s the reality of sharing what you are passionate about to the public.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My truck was broken into in the Charlotte area in November while eating dinner.  Got my range bag with three guns, accessories, a couple of laptops, my suitcase, and two big toolboxes.  About $7k all told.  You are right, filing a claim is a huge pain.  Receipts, or boxes, or pictures. Did the same as you with a spreadsheet, but there are some things (particularly tools) that I had owned for years with no receipts or any proof of ownership.  

Glad everything worked out for you.  I wouldn&#039;t wish it on anyone.]]></description>

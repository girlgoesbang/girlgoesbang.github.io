		<description><![CDATA[Nice seeing you here! You are absolutely right. At a competition both of you (competitor and range safety officer) should be paying attention, so typically it&#039;s expected that you will lock the slide open and both of you will visually inspect to see the gun is clear. We obviously missed that as well. 

I am super aware of where I&#039;m pointing the gun now when I make the final trigger pull to verify the gun is clear.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It happened,but is now an episode that can be referred to as you have already stated 
 Attention went to routine and a step was overlooked in the safe unloading process. The SO knew he had done wrong as you knew you had, but by keeping the gun under control in a safe direction kept as a safe memory to learn from and continue your good safety regime. 
Glad your first time ended well.]]></description>

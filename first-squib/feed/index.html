		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to post the link to Kathy Jackson&#039;s recent article on squibs here: http://www.corneredcat.com/squib/ . I mentioned this recently but want to point it out again. 

Very glad you did no damage to yourself or the new gun and this was a &quot;no loss&quot; learning scenario. Also glad you selected a gun that should avoid hurting you if a second round had gone down the barrel. 

And I agree that the team at PDHSC is great. They have fielded many questions from me and have made me start to feel like family.]]></description>

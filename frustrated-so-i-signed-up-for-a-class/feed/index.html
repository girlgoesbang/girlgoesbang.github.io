		<description><![CDATA[You get the &quot;Most Loyal Reader&quot; award for writing comments. It&#039;s always a pleasure to hear from you. 

I compete once or twice a month so if you want to go, just ask. Really. I&#039;d love to have a &quot;ringer&quot; for the new last place finisher. You will have fun, I promise. 

In my class last weekend, I was shooting a drill and had moved my ear protection to the top of my head, so I got my first experience with no ear protection. Wasn&#039;t terrible but it was noticeable. The odd part of the experience was this: I was so focused on the drill that it took me a minute to figure out what was wrong... 

And yes, you should recognize those targets :-)

Speaking of busy.... I&#039;m off to eat &amp; sleep...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey there.. how&#039;s life been? :-)  Work has been super busy; lots of stuff breaking, and even more stuff that&#039;s never worked right in years, if ever. I enjoy the challenge, but it&#039;s overwhelming at times. And, the more I learn, and the more I research, I&#039;m terrified over how little I seem to know. 

 I&#039;m confident I&#039;ll never get caught up at work.. I&#039;m re-commisioning some systems currently, and they seem to be able to break stuff faster than I can fix it. But. like you, I&#039;m hanging in there. Don&#039;t get frustrated; don&#039;t give up. :-)

 I haven&#039;t been shooting much lately.. if you don&#039;t want to end up dead last at a meet, just invite me along. I am looking to get into reloading a bit more.. ordered some supplies recently, now just have to find the time to get to the &#039;friend&#039;s house&#039; and get going. I&#039;ve actually been wanting to play with the .22 rifles lately.. 50 and 100 yard ranges. Seems like ammo availability is starting to loosen up; I was able to pick up a couple of bulk boxes of .22 recently. Was trying to get a case of .22 Wildcat, but it was delayed until May. And as usual, &#039;too much life, not enough time&#039;.

 The recent gun control news reports make me sad :-(  Have you seen this one yet?

&quot;Asked how a ban on magazines holding more than 15 rounds would be effective in reducing gun violence, DeGette said: 

‚ÄúI will tell you these are ammunition, they‚Äôre bullets, so the people who have those know they‚Äôre going to shoot them, so if you ban them in the future, the number of these high capacity magazines is going to decrease dramatically over time because the bullets will have been shot and there won‚Äôt be any more available.‚Äù&quot;

From the mouth of Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette, lead sponsor on a federal ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines. 

 On a happier note, a couple of comments on some of your recent blog posts;

 I recognize those targets!!

 Concerning your photo; I like the pose, and I want to take some like that, but playing with the depth of field and focus point. I like this shot from Goodfellas..

http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_DnPwaEn8aGE/TIKooBGgveI/AAAAAAAAKmE/9y-Ny4slGvw/s1600/Goodfellas_01.jpg

 I&#039;ve done some where the focus is on the end of the barrel.. cause that&#039;s where your attention would be focused, I suspect. 

 Anyway, consider this. Should the day arise you have to use lethal force against another (and I hope that day never arrives), are you going to be wearing protection.. hearing or otherwise? When I did my CC class, after we qualified, the instructor offered us the opportunity to simulate that situation. The scenario is a close quarters contact shot to the abdomen. I was using that snubnose .357.. can you see where this is going? Two shots to the adbomen; the cardboard was smoldering, and it took awhile for my hearing to come back. Glad I did it though.. I have a better understanding of what to expect. And.. as you know, if you had to do a low light/no light shoot with that hand cannon, you&#039;ll be blind after the first shot. 

 Ok, the sun is up, the day is warming, it&#039;s time to get off the keyboard and get back to other things. Good to see you&#039;re staying active with the shooting.. just remember, it takes more than a year to be a marksman.. err.. marksperson?

 Take care..]]></description>

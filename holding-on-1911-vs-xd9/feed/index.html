		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t have access to an XDM, so no I did not try one. I did try an H&amp;K P30 with the smallest grips &amp; backstrap and still found the smallest grips to be a stretch for my hands (see video below for how these can be adjusted). I think that the extra weight of the 1911 is making a bigger difference in my ability to control the gun than the decreased width. It&#039;s possible that may make a difference for your wife as well. Someone mentioned weighted grips to me, but I think my 1911 is close to the IPDA max weight already.

		<description><![CDATA[I was wondering if you tried an XDM with the interchangeable back-straps? My wife also has very small hands and she really likes her XDM 3.8 with the smallest insert.

Very nice 1911 BTW. I think I&#039;ll pick up some slim grips for mine and see if it fits my wife better.]]></description>

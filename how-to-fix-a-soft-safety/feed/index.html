		<description><![CDATA[Andrew, 
I have the same &quot;girlie gun&quot;: S&amp;W 1911 in 9mm. The 1911 because I have small hands and wanted a single stack. The 9mm to lower the cost of practice and match ammo. I paid just over $1300. I guess this is the low end of full sized 1911s but I&#039;d expect better for that price point. I&#039;m still shooting it though and every malfunction is a learning experience. 

It&#039;s also given the the opportunity to do a full take down and learn more about the inner workings of pistols. 

Thanks for stopping by!

		<description><![CDATA[I know this is an older post, but I&#039;m new here, catching up.

I&#039;ve carried a Wilson 1911 for, oh, more than 20 years.  PDW and my competition pistol, well over 100,000 rounds for it.  Just got smoother with time.

I did have ONE failure very late in that round count that was clearly a failure of the pistol, and that was when one of the &quot;stems&quot; of the plunger tube assembly sheered.  I sent it off to Wilson, they had it back to me in two days, fixed, and with two new magazines--no charge.

I also am an owner of a S&#038;W 1911 (but in 9mm--a &quot;girlie gun&quot; :-) ).  New from the gun store the thumb safety was so hard to press on and off as to be unmanageable (I&#039;m over 6&#039;, over 200 lbs, had to strain to work the thumb safety--my wife couldn&#039;t work it at all).  Took the thumb safety out, and the internal chunk was covered with burrs and other nonsense.  Threw it away, dropped in a Wilson replacement, and everything&#039;s fine.  But that&#039;s a hell of a thing in a 1911 I paid, I think, ~$1,300 for just a few years ago.

Anyway, just my two cents. :-)

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for contributing! This is my first and only 1911 so, having nothing to compare it to, I just figured that&#039;s how they worked. Boy was I wrong. 

It&#039;s kind of sad that it came that way, brand new from S&amp;W. I&#039;m more interested in shooting guns than working on modifications or I might have picked up on this earlier.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent notes!

Raised on the 1911, in all it&#039;s varied models/manufacturers/vintages, I&#039;ve come across a great variety in the feel of the thumb safety. A tactile click is pretty important.

I wanted to comment on that first image- the spring *should* have that kink in it- most manufacturers fail to provide it though ( usually just make it with a needle nose pliers when I come across a straight one) . The kink prevents the spring ( and the Plungers) from shooting off under the couch when the safety is removed.

Instead of using a jobber bit, I usually just replace a soft safety with one that has a pronouced peak on the bearing suface, as seen here:

There is a little dimple there in the Off position, but the positive feel of the safety comes from the sharper peak on the bearing surface. I&#039;ve found a few safetys to be dimpled too deeply to have a sticky feel to the safety instead of a nice clean positive click.]]></description>

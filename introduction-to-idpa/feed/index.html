		<description><![CDATA[Bummer. Well, I backed out on my Sig and will use my M&#038;P 9mm. Alas, I&#039;ll have to change the name of my blog.  Lets start shooting on Wednesdays; I&#039;m going tomorrow after work to rent Range Two.  Drop by if you can. I&#039;ve learned some new stuff from Mike.

trust but verify, david]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Come and shoot the match this Saturday -- March 22. I&#039;ll be shooting my Sig Sauer SP2022. Been awhile since I trained with that gun so I probably won&#039;t do so well -- DA/SA you know.  I&#039;ll be at the range on Wednesday afternoon around 5pm to get in some brief downrange time with the Sig before Saturday&#039;s match.

Hope to see you there. I&#039;m proud of you for keeping up this blog. I should do &quot;A Year with my Sig Sauer SP2022 and IDPA&quot; blog. There just aren&#039;t a lot of DA/SA folks shooting and that&#039;s a shame.

Using a Glock 19 I got my last match time down into the mid 1teens. But I miss my Sig and it&#039;s such a bad-ass looking firearm that I took it out of the safe this evening. It&#039;s my nightstand weapon but I&#039;m going to give it a try Saturday at IDPA.

So come on and have some fun.]]></description>

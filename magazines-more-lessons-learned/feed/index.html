		<description><![CDATA[My guns do not, but one of the ladies I compete against does have a gun configured this way. It causes delays in the competition when the RSO asks her to unload and show clear, pull the trigger (to verify it&#039;s unloaded), then holster. She has to drop the mag then put it back in to pull the trigger on the unloaded gun. For competition I wouldn&#039;t choose a gun with this configuration.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keep in mind that some semi-autos won&#039;t allow the weapon to be fired unless there&#039;s a magazine in place. Look up magazine disconnect. Don&#039;t know if yours are that way, some of mine are. Keep shooting straight Lady, and the bagels are always on me :-)]]></description>

		<p>I missed the IDPA matches nearest where I live in November and December due to family holiday obligations. I am also getting used to the 1911 I bought and was finally able to shoot in mid-November (after getting the grips downsized). I&#8217;m not used to a gun with a thumb safety and I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m a big fan at this point. However, I bought the gun, I paid a twice what I&#8217;ve paid for any other gun and I want to spend the time to give it a fair assessment.</p>
<p>So after 7 trips to the range to practice things that are new with this gun like the grip and draw with a thumb safety, I decided to shoot an outdoor match at The Range in Oxford today. This was my first outdoor match and the first match I&#8217;ve decided to shoot and not arranged to meet a friend there. I did email Frank to ask about the calendar and confirm what time the match started. I told him I&#8217;d be there as I wanted to make a commitment to someone. I&#8217;ve found that knowing I&#8217;m accountable to my word is a strong motivator for me and I was very nervous about this due to the new gun, new range, and no friends for moral support.</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_3323.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-326 alignright" title="IMG_3323" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_3323.jpg" alt="" width="301" height="117" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_3323.jpg 301w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_3323-300x116.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" /></a></p>
<p>This morning it was raining as I left my house but was clear as I arrived at The Range. The first lesson of the day is that registration starts at 11am but the match doesn&#8217;t start until 1pm. I&#8217;ll be targeting a 12:30 arrival in the future.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure what to wear as it was just over freezing when I left my house. Ideally I wanted to tuck in everything but my concealment garment. By 1pm it was warm enough to easily do that but I might consider a larger pair of jeans to be able to manage that with thicker layers on colder days. I used a fleece vest as a concealment garment today and that worked well.</p>
<p>I brought no food or water. I did eat a substantial breakfast and they sell bottled water at a bargain (50 cents), but I should be more self sufficient. Beef jerky, granola bars, or something portable would be a good idea.</p>
<p>My range bag is heavy. At an indoor match I&#8217;d park it in the room where we wait for an open stage and come back to it between stages. At an outdoor match you haul it around. The only thing I really needed was ammo and my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Butler-Creek-9mm--45-Universal-Unloader/dp/B001HBHNHE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357523302&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=uplula">UpLULA</a> (for me an absolute necessity). In the future, I think I&#8217;ll leave the range bag in the car and bring a smaller bag from stage to stage with just food, water and ammo.</p>
<p>I attended a safety briefing for &#8220;new shooters&#8221; and was reminded to put on the gun &amp; holster at the car then DO NOT take the gun out of the holster until I get up to the line to shoot. It stays in the holster until I put it back in the car at the end of the match.</p>
<p>They split us into 6 squads and started us in one of 6 bays. Our squad started in Bay 2. We proceeded to 3,4,5,6, and 1. It went fairly quickly. There were about 10 shooters per squad so about 60 folks competing.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it went for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>The thumb safety caused me all kinds of issues. I had not practiced loading a barney round then doing a chamber check. I loaded the first round. The RSO says, &#8220;put on your safety&#8221;. I pulled the empty mag out and put in the full mag. I went to do a chamber check and it turns out you can&#8217;t if the safety is on. I worked this all out but it flustered me enough I didn&#8217;t check that the mag was seated and&#8230;. of course&#8230;. it wasn&#8217;t.</li>
<li>I ran into multiple issues on the 2nd stage I shot. At one point I did a tactical reload and popped the partially full magazine in the waist band of my jeans. I must I pushed a bit harder than usual as the next thing I felt was the magazine snaking down my leg until it hit the ground. Another first!</li>
<li>I was more accurate than previous matches, at the cost of speed. But for now I&#8217;m happy with that trade-off.</li>
<li>I had a few conversations with other shooters and felt that the Range Safety Officers were supportive.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a good day!<br />

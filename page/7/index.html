<p>I&#8217;m a pistol shooter. I have very little experience with any other type of weapon. I recently posted an ad online looking for a partner to shoot defensive pistol matches. Why? I found that most male shooters are polite to single women shooters, but I wouldn&#8217;t call them welcoming. Possibly I&#8217;m considered a threat to someone&#8217;s marriage, I&#8217;m not sure. But it&#8217;s fairly boring going to a match for 4+ hours and not really engaging with anyone at more than an impersonal level. So to make it more compelling for me to shoot matches, I made an attempt at recruiting partner(s) through my extended network.</p>
<p>A total stranger popped up in response to the ad, and I ended up shooting an AR-15 out the second story window of his house at the backstop in his yard within two weeks. IT WAS A BLAST!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as crazy as it sounds. We have a mutual friend that vouched for him. I met him for dinner before driving to his house. Part of the conversation included him asking me if this was a passing phase or if I was serious about shooting. Fair enough. I liked his direct approach.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t share his background without his permission but we started by talking about range safety then shot pistols in his backyard into the backstop he&#8217;d built. He helped me understand &#8220;natural point of aim&#8221; a bit better and had me do some drills drawing from the holster and shooting the target with my eyes closed. After 6 or 8 shots I had a nice pattern &#8212; all about 12 inches to the right of the target. After a bit more observation he told me I was pushing the gun to the right when I added my support hand. This is something I&#8217;d like to work on more. When crazy things start to happen, it&#8217;s most likely I&#8217;ll point shoot. So I&#8217;d like to build that skill.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s more of a long gun kind of guy and offered to let me shoot one of his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15">AR-15s</a>. I brought some .223 rounds and we shot them all.</p>
<div id="attachment_909" style="width: 280px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_20140526_160322-sm.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-909 " alt="25 cents with a .223 hole from 55 yards" src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_20140526_160322-sm.jpg" width="270" height="245" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_20140526_160322-sm.jpg 450w, ../wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_20140526_160322-sm-300x272.jpg 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_20140526_160322-sm-330x300.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">25 cents with a .223 hole from 55 yards</p></div>
<p>Details:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">Range: 55 yards</span></li>
<li>Direction: from the 2nd floor of the house down into the backstop</li>
<li>I shot from benchrest</li>
<li>I used a scope</li>
</ul>
<p>We shot targets. He had paint balls so we propped them up on the target with thumb tacks and shot the paint balls. They go SPLAT! very nicely. I nailed 3 in a row on my first attempt and giggled like a kid. And as you can see, we shot coins too. I really wanted a souvenir.</p>
<p>I pretty sure there there is a 3 gun match in my future. If I wasn&#8217;t replacing the transmission in my car this week I&#8217;d be out shopping for AR-15 components.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not exactly sure if I&#8217;ve found a defensive pistol match partner, but I did have a great experience and if nothing else, I may have picked up yet another expensive hobby.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Yesterday, even though I had a bad cold, I showed up for the Women On Target event at the <a href="http://www.dcwc.info/">Durham County Wildlife Club</a>. I&#8217;ve volunteered at previous events, but this was the first time I&#8217;ve attended as a participant.</p>
<p>Sixty ladies attended and were separated into groups of 12 then spread across 5 clinic sessions. If you asked to be in the same group as friends or relatives, they will do their best to make that happen. I showed up solo and made a few new friends during the day.</p>
<p>Our group started with archery. We used practice bows. The instructors focused on form and I was able to hit the target, but I never actually figured out how to really aim the arrow. They have a trail with archery targets that sounded like a great way to spend an afternoon. The other big plus was that no ear protection was needed. It was nice and quiet.</p>
<p>Next we tried skeet. We shot 20 gauge shotguns at flying clay targets. They launched from a &#8220;high house&#8221; and flew left to right across a clear field (essentially toward us) and we did our best to lead the &#8220;bird&#8221; then knock them out of the sky. I was amazed that I actually hit about a third of my targets. For the second round we tried shooting from the &#8220;low house&#8221;. These launched right beside us and headed up and across the same field, essentially away from us. Again, I was amazed that I hit anything. Typically shooters will move to 8 different positions and shoot from both the high house and the low house.</p>
<p>We ended the morning at the pistol range. We shot .22lr pistols. The instructors there knew me for the most part, so I helped one of the instructors diagnose a finicky Ruger SR22. Sweet little gun, but I don&#8217;t think it liked the ammo. This was copper clad but somewhat blunt on the tip. I shot two full magazines with no issues, but had misfeeds, jams, or failure to feed on three other magazines. I like the white dot sites and I think it would make a great training gun with ammo it liked.</p>
<p>They fed us lunch catered from Moe&#8217;s. My cold left me with not much of an appetite, but that was my issue.They feed you well at this event.</p>
<div id="attachment_892" style="width: 237px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_20140413_122851crop.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-892" alt="Shot with a .22lr at 40 years (with a scope)" src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_20140413_122851crop-227x300.jpg" width="227" height="300" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_20140413_122851crop-227x300.jpg 227w, ../wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_20140413_122851crop.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shot with a .22lr at 40 years (with a scope)</p></div>
<p>After lunch we started with .22lr rifles. I shot 3 different models and shot at three different ranges: 40 yards, 75 yards and 100 yards. We shot from a benchrest and this is the first time I&#8217;ve ever shot with a scope. Like pistols, this requires you to aim and I liked that: taking my time to line up a shot then nail it. We all picked a playing card and set them up at 40 yards. I managed to hit mine &#8211; with the first shot.</p>
<p>I finally have an appreciation for distance and scopes.</p>
<p>Our last station for the day was trap. We shot 12 gauge shotguns from 5 different positions at clay targets moving away from us. As the instructor said, &#8220;Pull! Bang!&#8221;. The longer you wait to shoot it, the further away it gets and the tougher the shot gets. I managed to hit between a third to a half of my targets and found the shotgun recoil wasn&#8217;t that big of a deal. I also learned to get the heck out of the way of the shells when I broke open the gun after the shot. I only got popped in the face once.No harm done.</p>
<p>It was a good day. I&#8217;d never shot a shotgun before and I found I could not only shoot them, but I could hit moving targets. Amazing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d tried archery and .22 rifles as a kid at summer camp &#8211; about 4 decades ago &#8211; and still see the appeal. Pistols are still my first love however.</p>
<p>If you know any women who would like safe, enthusiastic exposure to a variety of firearms, the local Women on Target events in the spring and fall at this facility and the<a href="../../women-on-target/index.html"> facility where I volunteered two weeks ago</a> are a great opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Update: I saw this article posted today over at Cheaper Than Dirt on <a href="http://blog.cheaperthandirt.com/basics-sight-alignment-sight-picture-trigger-control-hitting/">all the basics of pistol shooting</a> so I thought I&#8217;d add that link here for new shooters.</p>
<p>Update: Here&#8217;s a link to an article in the local paper about the WOT events: <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/05/07/3843729/shooting-clinic-helps-women-learn.html">http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/05/07/3843729/shooting-clinic-helps-women-learn.html</a></p>

(ie: the front plate). All shots one handed at 15 feet.</p></div>
<p>I attended the monthly gathering of the the <a href="http://wclhgl.org/">Wake Country Ladies Handgun League</a> (LHGL) last Saturday. I opted to shoot the advanced shooter drill as I wanted practice time and I wanted a challenge.</p>
<p>The drill this month was to shoot one handed then switch to the other hand. We didn&#8217;t use a holster for this drill, just picked up the gun from the bay table.</p>
<p>We started with 7 rounds loaded in the magazine and shot 4 strong hand, transferred the gun to the  weak hand and finished up the last 3 shots.</p>
<p>Turns out the hard part of the transfer is getting the thumb of the shooting hand out of the way of the transfer hand. At least, that was my challenge.</p>
<p>I moved onto full magazines and transferring every 2 shots to practice the pass between hands. I realized after the fact that I may have gotten better results as neither hand was over tired by holding the gun for longer strings of shots.</p>
<p>To up the &#8220;ante&#8221; a bit, we overlapped paper plates, designated the front plate a non-threat (using IDPA terminology) and attempted to hit the back plate without &#8220;hurting&#8221; the non-threat. I posted a photo of my initial results with the first two magazines. No hits to the non-threat!</p>
<p>I used my XDS in 9mm for this exercise. I think the targets were out at about 15 feet.</p>
<p>To qualify for the advanced shooter drills with the LGHL you have to pass a basic gun handling safety test and a basic accuracy test with your shooting. It provides more challenge than just shooting downrange and adds skills to practice.</p>

<p>I just got home from spending a very cold day out at the <a href="http://www.sirwaltergunclub.com/">Sir Walter Gun Club</a> for a very good cause. I volunteered for an NRA Women on Target event that gives new female shooters an opportunity to shoot various firearms with coaching to keep them safe and help them be more successful shooters.</p>
<p>I worked the pistol plinking section. We loaded up 7 or 8 rounds in an M&amp;P 9mm semi-automatic pistol and coached the ladies through shooting the targets pictured above. The steel targets fall down when given a solid hit. If you hit them, but don&#8217;t drop them, they still give off a satisfying &#8220;ping&#8221;.</p>
<p>We covered stance, grip, aim, and trigger control. In our section we took 6 ladies through at a time then gave them all a second chance to shoot again.</p>
<p>We had all ages and <em>every</em> women we coached knocked down at least one of the steel targets.</p>
<p>The couple I was working with were also kind enough to let me take a turn and I managed to knock down all 6 targets pretty quickly. Just having an instructor certification doesn&#8217;t make you a good shooter, but in this case I didn&#8217;t embarrass myself.</p>
<p>I also made a new contact that may open up an opportunity to teach some more NRA.</p>
<p>The biggest lesson I learned today: bring extra layers. I have an emergency bag in the trunk of my car and I ended up digging out an extra layer and a pair of gloves that made me much more comfortable during a long cold day.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve been asked to do a short presentation on <a href="http://www.idpa.com/">IDPA</a> for the <a href="http://wclhgl.org/">Ladies Handgun League</a> down at the <a href="http://www.wakegov.com/sheriff/services/firingrange/Pages/default.aspx">Wake County Range</a>. I put together an outline and decided to post it here for future reference.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IDPA-Logo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1045" src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IDPA-Logo.jpg" alt="IDPA Logo" width="234" height="70" /></a></h1>
<h1>Intro to IDPA</h1>
<p>IDPA: International Defensive Pistol Association</p>
<h1>Purpose:</h1>
<p>• the use of practical equipment<br />
• to solve simulated “real world” self-defense scenarios</p>
<h1>Who Competes in IDPA?</h1>
<p>In a word, everybody. New comers are welcome and encouraged.</p>
<p>You should be comfortable:<br />
• drawing from a holster and reholstering<br />
• reloading / exchanging magazines in your pistol</p>
<p><strong>IDPA Safety Rules / Reviewed at every match!</strong><br />
• All guns are always loaded.<br />
• Never let the muzzle cover anything you are not willing to destroy.<br />
• Keep your finger off the trigger till your sights are on the target.<br />
• Identify your target, and what is behind it.</p>
<p>(Versus  NRA Gun Safety Rules)<br />
• Always point the gun in a safe direction.<br />
• Keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot.<br />
• Keep the gun unloaded until ready to use.</p>
<h1>Skills you are exposed to:</h1>
<p>• Emphasis on range safety<br />
• Drawing from concealment<br />
• Strong hand and weak hand shooting<br />
• Shooting while moving, kneeling or prone<br />
• Shooting moving targets<br />
• Using cover properly<br />
• Reloads<br />
• Tactical priority (near to far)<br />
• Tactical sequence (one shot each before additional shots)<br />
• Threats vs. non-threats,<br />
• Shooting for both speed and accuracy<br />
• Adding the adrenaline rush you may experience in real life</p>
<h1>How does a Match work?</h1>
<p>• Typically 6-8 stages over 4-6 hours<br />
• Break into squads – squad leader will work with you. People are friendly and typically helpful to a new shooter.<br />
• Your squad arrives at each stage as a group.<br />
• Your squad leader will brief the squad on the scenario and any requirements.<br />
• You may all load and make ready as a squad or each shooter may load and make ready as it is there turn to shoot.<br />
• Every one helps to paste targets<br />
• You can ask to see how you did</p>
<h1>Examples of Stages</h1>
<p>• &#8220;You are in the shower&#8230;&#8221; and you start by opening a shower curtain and picking up your gun from a side table<br />
• At a major match: shoot out a window through a rain storm (actually a hose&#8230;)<br />
• &#8220;You are on the couch, watching the Super Bowl and your gun is on the coffee table. Sit up and shoot your first target before standing.&#8221;<br />
• At a major match: Shoot from the driver&#8217;s seat of a car, at night, through a burning engine at your targets (this was a rare night match).</p>
<h1>What to Bring</h1>
<p>• Ear &amp; eye protection (MANDATORY)<br />
• Handgun, caliber 9mm or larger<br />
• •  Sights must be stock. No lasers, scopes, or lights mounted on pistol are allowed.<br />
• OWB holster that covers the trigger guard (ladies can use a dropped, offset holster).<br />
• Should have at least 3 magazines for your pistol (you can shoot with 2)<br />
• Magazine holster that goes on your belt for each extra magazine<br />
• Belt to support your gun and magazine holsters<br />
• A concealment garment- ie vest or long shirt<br />
• About 150 rounds of ammo<br />
• Some form of range bag to keep your items in.<br />
• Baseball cap recommended – especially for outdoor matches.<br />
• Water &amp; Snacks!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a link to a Triangle Tactical article that talks about <a href="http://www.triangletactical.net/2014/02/24/idpa-cheap-70/">IDPA &#8220;on the cheap&#8221;</a> for equipment sources.</p>
<h1>Gun Handling</h1>
<p>• All events are cold ranges.<br />
• Come with your gun unloaded.<br />
• You will be told when/where to load and unload your gun.<br />
• Unless you have been told to load &amp; make ready, DO NOT TOUCH YOUR GUN.<br />
• If you are not sure of when/where you can handle your firearm simply leave it holstered and ask.</p>
<h1>Range Commands (not exhaustive&#8230;)</h1>
<p>• Load and Make Ready<br />
• Unload and Show Clear<br />
• Finger: You will hear this if your finger is in the trigger guard while moving or reloading.<br />
• Muzzle: If you hear this, immediately check yourself as your muzzle is getting near a muzzle<br />
safe point.<br />
• Stop: If a shooter is being grossly unsafe, or if a safety issue has arisen on the range<br />
• Cover: If a shooter is not using cover adequately</p>

<p>I took a break from shooting due to the cost of the ammo I was burning through. I also realized I was shooting for fun, but not really improving my skills. I decided to take my shooting in a different direction in the short term.</p>
<p>My mom asked me to take her shooting, a woman I used to work for asked me to take her shooting, and a volunteer opportunity I signed up for resulted in me coaching new women shooters. All that seemed to point in one direction: learn to teach.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been up to:</p>
<ul>
<li>I volunteered for a <a href="http://women.nra.org/womens-instructional-shooting-clinics.aspx">Women On Target<sup>®</sup></a> (WOT) event October 20, 2013 at the <a href="http://www.dcwc.info/about.php">Durham County Wildlife Club</a>. The great ladies that run the event encouraged me to get my pistol instructor certification so&#8230;</li>
<li>I passed an NRA certified Pistol Instructor class on November 10th, 2013.</li>
<li>I volunteered to teach a section of a NRA 1st Steps Pistol (Ladies Only) class sponsored by the <a href="http://www.wakegov.com/sheriff/services/firingrange/Pages/default.aspx">Wake County Range</a> on December 8, 2013</li>
<li>I passed an NRA Range Safety Officer course on Sunday February 2, 2014.</li>
<li>I volunteered for a <a href="http://women.nra.org/womens-instructional-shooting-clinics.aspx">Women On Target®</a> (WOT) event March 30, 2014 at the <a href="http://www.sirwaltergunclub.com/">Sir Walter Gun Club</a>. I worked the &#8220;pistol plinking&#8221; event where we taught women to shoot 9mm pistols and shoot steel targets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do I feel I&#8217;m ready to go out and start a business teaching people to shoot? Heck no! But I do want to find volunteer opportunities to work with more seasoned instructors and build my skills.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really a thrill to see a group of ladies walk into a class room with some level of trepidation and/or anticipation at the beginning of a class then see them leave with a sense of real accomplishment ( and a target with bullet holes in it!) at the end of the day.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>For most of the last year I&#8217;ve shot one of my guns at least once a week. I bought a gold membership at PDHSC and while that was in effect, it was an easy decision to go to the range and shoot. I&#8217;d limit myself to 100 rounds most visits and I&#8217;d be there about an hour.For some months I had a shooting partner and we would discuss drills and ideas, but most of those trips were solo.</p>
<p>During that time I&#8217;ve come along way with my gun handling skills and safety awareness. I remember early on when I&#8217;d pick up a magazine and I&#8217;d have to puzzle out which direction it should face when I put it in the gun. That is now something I don&#8217;t question.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve shot competitions and I&#8217;m past the point of nerves and adrenaline. I&#8217;m reasonably competent but I&#8217;m not a competitive shooter. But that isn&#8217;t improving.</p>
<p>With the expiration of my gold membership, I&#8217;ve decided to rethink how I&#8217;m spending my &#8220;gun time&#8221;. Continuing to put lead downrange is fun, but I&#8217;m not convinced I&#8217;m structuring my range time to be productive.</p>
<p>Also, with the purchase of the XDS, I want to get comfortable with carrying a gun other than at the range and at a competition. That is what prompted the last post in carrying in the car &#8212; and I appreciate all the feedback on why I should not leave the gun in the car permanently.</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_20130714_191834sm.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-826" alt="IMG_20130714_191834sm" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_20130714_191834sm.jpg" width="450" height="596" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_20130714_191834sm.jpg 450w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_20130714_191834sm-226x300.jpg 226w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>I bought a Remora Concealment Holster and intend to start carrying it around the house with the gun unloaded at first just to see how this works. It has a rigid opening and doesn&#8217;t collapse when the gun is drawn, it has a flap to make it &#8220;tuckable&#8221;, there is a clip but it can be removed (it snaps on), and it&#8217;s a &#8220;sticky&#8221; holster. I tried it on in the store at 9Forward and it felt comfortable.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;ve drawn from it and it&#8217;s very different from the dropped, offset holsters I&#8217;ve been using for competition. It was at this point that I realized that I might want to switch my focus from &#8220;getting better at competition&#8221; to &#8220;getting better at self-defense&#8221;. I&#8217;m not going to be able to conceal a dropped offset holster unless it&#8217;s a very cold day and I have no plans to remove my coat, so I think I need to suck it up and start working with the equipment that is practical for everyday carry &#8212; even if it&#8217;s not designed with the easy access of a competition holster.</p>

<p>When I buy something, I like to use it. I&#8217;m up to four 9mm pistols at this point and I&#8217;m going through a process of deciding where each &#8220;fits&#8221; in my life &#8212; or whether to sell one of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve parked the H&amp;K in my bedroom. It&#8217;s the only gun I have with night sights.</li>
<li>When I bought the 1911 it replaced the XD9 as my competition gun (for now). I tried putting the XD9 in the car, but I wanted it in the center console. It&#8217;s too big. I can&#8217;t really reach the glove box quickly but I can pop the center console and access items next to me fast. So the XD9 went back in my range bag as a back up competition gun.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have  a CCW but I haven&#8217;t gotten comfortable carrying a loaded gun on my body outside of the range or competitions. So I decided my next baby step would be to carry in the car.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been reading you know I bought the XDS in 9mm. It&#8217;s a perfect fit for the glove box. I took the holster that came with the gun and attached it to a heavy CD case (metallic blue with a zipper in the photo) using a rubber band in order to test out the concept. The holster keeps the gun upright and centered. The CD case keeps the holster in place when I draw the gun. I practice drawing at least once a day now and I&#8217;m happy with this system. I just want to find something more reliable than a rubber band to make it work.</p>
<p>The next time I&#8217;m at The Range and it&#8217;s fairly empty and dry, I will try driving my car out into a bay and practice a S L O W draw with a transition to shoot through the driver&#8217;s window and or passenger window.</p>
<p>At this point I have questions. So if you are reading and you are willing to share:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">Do you carry in your car? Why or why not? </span></li>
<li>Where do you carry?</li>
<li>Do you leave the gun in the car full time or remove it once you are home?</li>
</ul>
<p>I have many conversations with shooters but never with a consistent mentor and this is the kind of thing I will figure out on my own, but would really like pointers.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>No I&#8217;m not talking about dancing or sex, although I can dance a fabulous east or west coast swing. I&#8217;m talking about moving targets.</p>
<p>When I complete in IDPA most matches have a few of these and that is the only time I get the chance to attempt to shoot them. So I took Frank up on the offer to come shoot at The Range over the July 4th holiday. There was one stage at the Carolina Cup that had two swingers and no electronics. I was hoping they were still in place and I was in luck. I also wanted to spend some time with the XDs 9mm  I bought just before the Cup.</p>
<div id="attachment_804" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Single-Swinger-before-sm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-804 " alt="Single Swinger before" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Single-Swinger-before-sm.jpg" width="450" height="374" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Single-Swinger-before-sm.jpg 450w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Single-Swinger-before-sm-300x249.jpg 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Single-Swinger-before-sm-360x300.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Single Swinger before</p></div>
<p>In the photo above and below, look for the &#8220;L&#8221; shaped metal boot .Step one is to hit the boot. That sets the target swinging.</p>
<div id="attachment_805" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Double-Swinger-before-sm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-805 " alt="Double Swinger before" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Double-Swinger-before-sm.jpg" width="450" height="310" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Double-Swinger-before-sm.jpg 450w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Double-Swinger-before-sm-300x206.jpg 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Double-Swinger-before-sm-435x300.jpg 435w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Double Swinger before</p></div>
<p>I remember during the competition shooting through the straw bails to hit the target as it was swinging and seeing straw go flying. This time I wanted to be able to set it up, try shooting, see the results and try it again to see if I could figure out how to hit these.</p>
<div id="attachment_806" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Single-Swinger-after-sm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-806" alt="Single Swinger after" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Single-Swinger-after-sm.jpg" width="450" height="440" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Single-Swinger-after-sm.jpg 450w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Single-Swinger-after-sm-300x293.jpg 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Single-Swinger-after-sm-306x300.jpg 306w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Single Swinger after</p></div>
<p>I tried this several times and never did figure out how to go about hitting the moving target. I got some lead on the targets but I have to admit it was a stroke of fortune, not skill.</p>
<p>I also realized that once the target stopped swinging, I could continue with the current magazine by switching to head shots. I seemed to do worse with the double swinger than I did with the single swinger, but possibly that was because i had twice as many opportunities to miss.</p>
<div id="attachment_807" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Double-Swinger-after-left-sm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-807 " alt="Double Swinger in motion" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Double-Swinger-after-left-sm.jpg" width="450" height="381" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Double-Swinger-after-left-sm.jpg 450w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Double-Swinger-after-left-sm-300x254.jpg 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Double-Swinger-after-left-sm-354x300.jpg 354w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Double Swinger in motion</p></div>
<p>It was very muddy after all the rain we have had and I managed to show up at a cookout later that afternoon with red mud on my jeans but I was really happy to have to opportunity to give this a try. Also, the more I shoot the XDs the more I like it.</p>
<div id="attachment_808" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Double-Swinger-after-right-sm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-808 " alt="Double Swinger back behind cover" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Double-Swinger-after-right-sm.jpg" width="450" height="350" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Double-Swinger-after-right-sm.jpg 450w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Double-Swinger-after-right-sm-300x233.jpg 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Double-Swinger-after-right-sm-385x300.jpg 385w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Double Swinger back behind cover</p></div>
<p>One other note: Frank says he knows the website is down for the Range and they are working on getting it back up. You can find contact info <a href="http://the-carolinacup.com/?p=contact">here </a>if you want to check the schedule while the site is down.</p>

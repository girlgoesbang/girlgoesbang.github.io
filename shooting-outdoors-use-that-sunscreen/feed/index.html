		<description><![CDATA[My uncle had skin cancer and our family has since been religious about applying sunscreen outdoors. I love shooting at outdoor ranges but it&#039;s the long days of fishing that really get me. Hope you&#039;re doing better by now. - Carl]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Update: &quot;no big deal&quot; is going to leave a 4 inch scar down my forearm. I watched most of the surgery and kept thinking... &quot;you need to stop watching, that&#039;s pretty disturbing&quot;. I&#039;ll spare you pictures since I couldn&#039;t take them one handed. Maybe when I change the bandages. LOL. 

Doc says no shooting for at least two weeks them see how I&#039;m healing. I don&#039;t think anyone every asked him about that sport before. I&#039;m hoping to shoot the next Wake Action Pistol match in exactly two weeks (a few hours after I get  the stitches out).]]></description>

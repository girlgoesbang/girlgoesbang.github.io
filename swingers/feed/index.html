		<description><![CDATA[I have been told that most swingers will swing the equal distance as they are set during the first swing...The trick is during your walk through or initial observation look at the angle they are set at and try to estimate that distance in the opposite direction. That&#039;s where the target will be when they are triggered. This theory works most of the time. Be quick and good luck!]]></description>

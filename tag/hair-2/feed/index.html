				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I came to shooting through my interest in disaster preparedness. I have been following several blogs over the last few years and when I saw this article it made me chuckle: <a href="http://www.shtfblog.com/post-apocalyptic-hair-styles/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+SHTFblog-AreYouReady+%28SHTF+blog.com+-+are+YOU+ready%3F%29">Post Apocalyptic Hair Styles</a>. It&#8217;s a girl thing, I know&#8230;</p>
<p>I have long hair and I like it. I&#8217;ve found ways to keep maintenance at a minimum over the years. When I ventured into shooting, just as with several other past interests, I had to think about how to ensure it didn&#8217;t cause a problem.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_81" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/That-Hair.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-81" title="That Hair" src="http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/That-Hair.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="480" srcset="http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/That-Hair.jpg 350w, http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/That-Hair-218x300.jpg 218w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One long braid in the back works well with a hat. [photo:coleimage.com]</p></div>A day of shooting paper at the range doesn&#8217;t really require too much thought about my hair. When I plan to draw from concealment, getting and keeping my hair out of the way matters.</p>
<p>One long braid down the back is the fastest and easiest solution. I make the effort to get creative at times and will post some of those photos in the future.</p>
<p>It turns out a single braid down the back works very well with a hat. When I shot my <a href="http://girlgoesbang.com/shooting-my-idpa-classifier/">classifier</a> I had not thought about dealing with bright sunlight. When Frank suggested a hat, the braid fit great through the gap in the back.</p>
<p>Other styles I like work fine with earmuffs, but would not work with the hat. So this will be the default outdoor shooting style for me.</p>

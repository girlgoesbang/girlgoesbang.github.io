				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I still feel like I&#8217;m drinking from the fire hose most days when I talk to people who have been shooting for years. I really, really appreciate a few of my mentors who will let me ask questions and slow down or back track to give me more detail about something they take for granted.</p>
<p>That said, I&#8217;ve learned not to ask if I&#8217;m not willing to listen to the answer. And &#8220;gun people&#8221; can be very, very opinionated. There are several debates I&#8217;ve run across over and over in the short time I&#8217;ve been researching forums that are a source of never ending argument. For example:</p>
<p>&#8211; 9mm vs. .45cal<br />
&#8211; 1911 vs. all other handguns<br />
&#8211; Glock vs. all other handguns</p>
<p>If I ask a dozen people the same question, I&#8217;ll get a dozen different answers and at least 5 of those will assure me their answer is the &#8220;right&#8221; answer. It can be frustrating and maddening. They can&#8217;t all be right.</p>
<p>I realized that the answers to these questions are ultimately personal. One comment I read on a forum put this into perspective for me: &#8220;Your question is akin to asking which underwear will fit you best.&#8221;</p>
<p>I continue to read, ask and consider. But I&#8217;ve come to understand that no one can make these decisions for<strong> <em>me</em></strong>, and reading with never give me answers. I need to make a decision and move forward. Based on the experience I gain I can determine if that was a good decision for me.</p>

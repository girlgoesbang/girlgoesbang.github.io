		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the comment. Miss seeing you! I think it&#039;s great you are passing on knowledge and helping people to find what works best for them. 

I stocked up an ammo last year when I heard the stories about the last election... and how hard it was to find ammo for a time afterward. That&#039;s also why I decided to stick with one caliber in a defensive weapon, so I wouldn&#039;t feel the need to stock up on multiple calibers. 

If you do find a source for bulk purchases, let me know. The range we&#039;ve shot at had good prices on 1,000 rounds of 9mm a few weeks back but I think they are all sold out at this time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good on ya for taking Mom shooting! I took one of the youngsters from work out to my buddy&#039;s range. She had just picked up an 870 12 gauge for a deal, but was worried about the 12 gauge kick. I borrowed a 20 gauge to let her see the different between the 20 and the 12. By the end of the day she was shooting a tactical 12 gauge and my AR-15... and she wants her own ones. :-) &#039;Twas a good day. How are you doing with. 22 ammo? I&#039;m running lower than I&#039;d like, but haven&#039;t seen any locally. Planning to do a bulk purchase if I can&#039;t find any. Got any sources, or want to get in on the buy? Take care, Dancing Bear.. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bruce, 
You can download the match results here: http://the-carolinacup.com/results/2013/Results.pdf. Unfortunately, the scoring system doesn&#039;t track special categories, so to get the winners for the Junior, Ladies, International, Military, Senior and Distinguished Senior groups we pulled that manually.  There is no published result for the group as a whole that I&#039;m aware of. If that is important to you, you should reach out to the match director and let him know.

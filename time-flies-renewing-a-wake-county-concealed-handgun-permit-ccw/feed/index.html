		<description><![CDATA[Dena,
It would depend on where you live and who issued the permit. In Wake County, NC the permits are for 5 years. For now I have stepped back from shooting due to several events in my life. If you are looking for female instructors in my area, I&#039;d recommend attending the Ladies Handgun League at the Wake County Range. Several of the organizers are excellent instructors. Or check in at Triangle Shooting Academy near Brier Creek. I believe they have female instructors on staff. 

Thanks for stopping by!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi!  Thanks for this post- I’m not computer friendly &#038; get exhausted trying to find info on the dark web- and as you mentioned, everything you read isn’t always true.
So- how long does my CCW/Permit last?  I had thought it was 3 years, but you mentioned 5.
Just curious- do you give one on one instruction?  I know how to shoot- have been since I was 8.   I could use extra time with maintenance (and of course practice.)
Thanks so much!

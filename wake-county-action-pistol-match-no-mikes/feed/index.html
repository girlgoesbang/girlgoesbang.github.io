		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, you&#039;re right. Moment of doubt overcome by carrying my FNS around all day today. With the right heavyweight shirts bought at Bass Pro Shop today there was no sign of printing. And it was comfortable. However, I really do like the Wild Bill&#039;s leather concealment holsters over the Kydex one I have for it. The gun rides higher on my hip.

Feel much better now. Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Only you can answer that question. If you are shooting matches to win, then pick a gun and stick with it. If you are shooting matches to build your carry skills, shoot with the gun you carry. As your priorities or goals change, adapt accordingly. But you already know all this, eh?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So I&#039;m conflicted. I&#039;m writing this looking at my Glock G19 and my FNS-9, knowing that the Glock conceals better but the FNH fits my hand and shoots better. What the hell do I do? I compete in IDPA regularly and try and carry somewhat regularly. What do I practice and compete with? The gun I carry or the gun that fits my hand more naturally and draws cleaner?

So many questions, so much confliction. Please help me settle on one gun for the long haul.

By the way, I shot the 11/29 Action Pistol match with my FNS and did reasonably well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad you enjoyed yourself at the match! I ran a squad and had a great time as well. Only my second time playing RO, so I was a little out of my element, but it was fun. Anything we could do better?]]></description>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Yesterday, even though I had a bad cold, I showed up for the Women On Target event at the <a href="http://www.dcwc.info/">Durham County Wildlife Club</a>. I&#8217;ve volunteered at previous events, but this was the first time I&#8217;ve attended as a participant.</p>
<p>Sixty ladies attended and were separated into groups of 12 then spread across 5 clinic sessions. If you asked to be in the same group as friends or relatives, they will do their best to make that happen. I showed up solo and made a few new friends during the day.</p>
<p>Our group started with archery. We used practice bows. The instructors focused on form and I was able to hit the target, but I never actually figured out how to really aim the arrow. They have a trail with archery targets that sounded like a great way to spend an afternoon. The other big plus was that no ear protection was needed. It was nice and quiet.</p>
<p>Next we tried skeet. We shot 20 gauge shotguns at flying clay targets. They launched from a &#8220;high house&#8221; and flew left to right across a clear field (essentially toward us) and we did our best to lead the &#8220;bird&#8221; then knock them out of the sky. I was amazed that I actually hit about a third of my targets. For the second round we tried shooting from the &#8220;low house&#8221;. These launched right beside us and headed up and across the same field, essentially away from us. Again, I was amazed that I hit anything. Typically shooters will move to 8 different positions and shoot from both the high house and the low house.</p>
<p>We ended the morning at the pistol range. We shot .22lr pistols. The instructors there knew me for the most part, so I helped one of the instructors diagnose a finicky Ruger SR22. Sweet little gun, but I don&#8217;t think it liked the ammo. This was copper clad but somewhat blunt on the tip. I shot two full magazines with no issues, but had misfeeds, jams, or failure to feed on three other magazines. I like the white dot sites and I think it would make a great training gun with ammo it liked.</p>
<p>They fed us lunch catered from Moe&#8217;s. My cold left me with not much of an appetite, but that was my issue.They feed you well at this event.</p>
<div id="attachment_892" style="width: 237px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_20140413_122851crop.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-892" alt="Shot with a .22lr at 40 years (with a scope)" src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_20140413_122851crop-227x300.jpg" width="227" height="300" srcset="http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_20140413_122851crop-227x300.jpg 227w, http://girlgoesbang.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_20140413_122851crop.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shot with a .22lr at 40 years (with a scope)</p></div>
<p>After lunch we started with .22lr rifles. I shot 3 different models and shot at three different ranges: 40 yards, 75 yards and 100 yards. We shot from a benchrest and this is the first time I&#8217;ve ever shot with a scope. Like pistols, this requires you to aim and I liked that: taking my time to line up a shot then nail it. We all picked a playing card and set them up at 40 yards. I managed to hit mine &#8211; with the first shot.</p>
<p>I finally have an appreciation for distance and scopes.</p>
<p>Our last station for the day was trap. We shot 12 gauge shotguns from 5 different positions at clay targets moving away from us. As the instructor said, &#8220;Pull! Bang!&#8221;. The longer you wait to shoot it, the further away it gets and the tougher the shot gets. I managed to hit between a third to a half of my targets and found the shotgun recoil wasn&#8217;t that big of a deal. I also learned to get the heck out of the way of the shells when I broke open the gun after the shot. I only got popped in the face once.No harm done.</p>
<p>It was a good day. I&#8217;d never shot a shotgun before and I found I could not only shoot them, but I could hit moving targets. Amazing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d tried archery and .22 rifles as a kid at summer camp &#8211; about 4 decades ago &#8211; and still see the appeal. Pistols are still my first love however.</p>
<p>If you know any women who would like safe, enthusiastic exposure to a variety of firearms, the local Women on Target events in the spring and fall at this facility and the<a href="../women-on-target/index.html"> facility where I volunteered two weeks ago</a> are a great opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Update: I saw this article posted today over at Cheaper Than Dirt on <a href="http://blog.cheaperthandirt.com/basics-sight-alignment-sight-picture-trigger-control-hitting/">all the basics of pistol shooting</a> so I thought I&#8217;d add that link here for new shooters.</p>
<p>Update: Here&#8217;s a link to an article in the local paper about the WOT events: <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/05/07/3843729/shooting-clinic-helps-women-learn.html">http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/05/07/3843729/shooting-clinic-helps-women-learn.html</a></p>

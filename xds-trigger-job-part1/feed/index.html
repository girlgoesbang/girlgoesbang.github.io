		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for stopping by! I couldn&#039;t effectively shoot the 45 ACP. I had problems with limp wristing at that time. I doubt it would be an issue now, but it was. I picked the 9mm due to cost of ammo and the extra rounds. I understand that many gun owners love their 1911s but I&#039;ve found plastic guns to be more reliable for me. Hope the trigger jobs get you to an acceptable trigger pull!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have 2 XDs both .45s,mine has about 7 lbs trigger,but the wife&#039;s feels like 14 lbs,it is way too heavy,I am going to do the upgrade on both.
I bought the larger capacity mags for them, we both have 2 mags each.
I bought these guns bc of their light weight,but they can t hold a candle next to my Kimber ultra carry,or my Colt government model. These will be the only plastic guns I ever buy.]]></description>
